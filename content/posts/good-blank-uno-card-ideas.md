The dangers of big ideas
Most people think of big ideas as being a good thing. After all, they’re the things that change the world. But there is a downside to having big ideas. They can be dangerous.
For one thing, big ideas are often disruptive. They can upend established ways of doing things and create chaos in the process. That’s not always a bad thing, but it can be. And even when it leads to positive change, it can be difficult and painful for those who are caught in the middle of it.

Another danger of big ideas is that they can be overwhelming. When we’re faced with a big problem, it can be tempting to try to solve it with a single, grand solution. But that rarely works out well. Complex problems usually require multiple smaller solutions working together.

Changes in the job market: 2019 predictions for the US economy
The job market continues to grow, with new jobs being created at a steady clip. But the future of the economy is still uncertain, as there are several possible trends that could affect the job market in the next few years. 
One trend that could have an impact on the job market is a rise in automation. This technology is slowly changing the way businesses operate, and as it does, many jobs will become obsolete or difficult to fill. As automation takes hold, many people may have to move into new positions, which could lead to increased unemployment rates. 

Another potential trend that could affect the job market in the next few years is a rise in wages. This increase may be due to factors such as better economic conditions and rising productivity levels. However, it can also happen as a result of negotiations between companies and unions over wages.

Conclusion: Some potential ideas that could be implemented in order to improve the current system.
One potential idea that could be implemented in order to improve the current system is an overhaul of the job listings process. This could be done through a crackdown on fake job postings, as well as more stringent verification processes for candidates. Another idea would be to change the way qualifications are assessed. currently, many jobs are filled with people with just a high school diploma or less. This could be changed so that only those who have had at least some college education are considered for a job, and those with higher qualifications are given a more chance to apply. Finally, there is the question of how to make sure that employees are happy and productive. Currently, many employees feel forced to work long hours for little pay, and sometimes don’t have enough opportunities for socialization.
