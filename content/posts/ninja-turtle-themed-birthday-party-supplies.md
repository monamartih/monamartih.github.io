coming up with new ways to do things: How can businesses come up with new ideas that work?
Businesses have been coming up with new ideas for years, but it can be hard to pinned down what works and what doesn't. Here are three tips to help you come up with new ideas: 
1. Try different methods of marketing: This might seem like a common-sense tip, but often times the best way to find a new customer is to try something different. Go beyond just traditional methods like advertising and social media promotion. 

2. Be open to change: When it comes time to come up with a new idea, don't be afraid to experiment. Sometimes the best way to find out if something is working is to give it a try and see what happens. 

3. Be persistent: It takes some effort – even stubbornness – to come up with new ideas that work.

Mental training: What is it, how can we do it, and why should we bother?
Mental training is the process of increasing a person's ability to think, focus, and decision-making. There are many reasons to care about mental training, including improving your work performance, increasing your overall well-being, and preventing depression and anxiety. Here are five big ideas about how mental training can benefit you:
1. Improve Your Work Performance: Mental training can help you better focus on tasks at hand and achieve success in your workplace. In a study published in the journal "Personality Psychology," researchers found that people who had learned to think faster were more productive than those who did not. The faster you learn to think, the better prepared you will be for any task that comes your way.

2. Increase Your Overall Well-Being: Mental training has been shown to improve mood and reduce stress levels.
