Creative tools and techniques: What makes creativity so special?
Creativity is a complex and subjective concept, but there are some general principles that can underlie its definition. One of these principles is the ability to see things in a new way. This skill is often used to come up with new ideas or solutions for problems. Another principle is the ability to take risks. When creativity flourishes, it can lead to new ideas, products, or even services that are better than those that were available before.

Invention of the World Wide Web
In 1839, Nicholas-Jacques Conte wrote a paper on the idea of a world wide web, which would eventually be called the Internet. The first real steps were made in 1947 when Claude Shannon and others developed the theory of information theory, which allowed for the Transmission of Information over Communications Channels. The following year, IBM created an electronic computer called Punchy, which was used to test communication protocols on. In 1951, Xerox PARC developed the Alto computer system that could be connected to a network. On August 29th of that year, US president Harry Truman announced his plan to create the American National Telecommunications Commission (ANTC), which would control all federal telecommunications regulations. This was the beginning of what is now known as the Internet era.
