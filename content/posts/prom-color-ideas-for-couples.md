What are the trends for 2022?
The term "Ideas 2022" is becoming more and more popular as the year comes to a close. It is an umbrella term that refers to a number of different concepts and ideas that could have a major impact on society in the coming years. Some of the ideas include: 
1) Moving towards electric vehicles – A recent study by The National Academy of Sciences found that electric vehicles are growing more popular, with almost half of all Americans now owning one. This trend is likely to continue, as more people see them as an affordable and environmentally friendly option. 
2) Reducing income inequality – Another idea being discussed is whether or not to implement social welfare policies that help those who have less money than others. This could mean lower taxes for the rich, or increasing benefits for those who need it most.
