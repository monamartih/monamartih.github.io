Conclusion: What are the benefits and challenges of big ideas?
Big ideas are a time-tested way to solve unique problems. They're also a challenge to create because they often require a new perspective and an innovative approach to what's already been tried. While big ideas can have significant benefits, there are also risks associated with them, which can influence their success or failure. Here are three key Takeaways from the past several years of big idea development: 
1. Big ideas can be successful if they're based on sound principles and backed up by research.
2. The risks associated with big ideas can impact their success or failure, and those risks need to be considered when developing them.

Other Ideas: How do you go about thinking of other creative ideas?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but they all have one common goal: to improve the process of thinking. Here are a few tips on how to consider other creative ideas:
1. Look at your current work and ask yourself what you can improve. What are the areas that need improvement? How can you make those improvements?
2. Brainstorm with a group of people. When you come up with new ideas, it can be helpful to have others involved. Why not group together and brainstorm some potential solutions to problems you're currently facing? This will help you to formulate new ideas more effectively.
3. Take a step back and think about your goals. Once you've identified some areas that need improvement, what do you want to achieve with your change? What kind of results do you envision for your new efforts?
