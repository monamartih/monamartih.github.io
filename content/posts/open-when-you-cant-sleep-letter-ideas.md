Invention: A Process
Invention is a process. It involves coming up with a new idea, working on it until it’s perfected, and then bringing that idea to the world. There are many different ways to come up with ideas, but the key is to keep working on it until you have an invention that works. Inventors are always looking for ways to improve their inventions, and there are many different methods for doing this.
