Projects: How to do a project without any tools?
If you're like most people, you probably think of when you need to do a project without any tools, it's when you're in your garage or workshop. But there are many ways to do a project without any tools that can be very satisfying. Here are two examples: 
1. Make a DIY painting project: Start by picking the colors you want and drawing the basic shapes for your painting using pencil and paper. Once you have a basic idea, just start painting! You can use whatever materials you have lying around the house, such as cans of paint or spray cans of different colors. 

2. Build an Ikea chest: This is another great way to do a project without any tools! All you need is some wood screws and nails, some light-tricks (like X-acto knives), and some sandpaper (if needed).

What are big ideas?
Big ideas are the seeds of new, innovative ideas that can change the way we live and work. From developing new transportation systems to improving food quality, there are many ways to put big ideas into practice.
One way to get started onbig ideas is by thinking about what others have done before you. When you come up with a great idea, don’t just credit yourself – give your idea a name and make it a point to share it with others. This way, you can get feedback and help others build on your idea.

Once you’ve got some good big ideas under your belt, it’s time for the hard part: coming up with ways to make them a reality.
