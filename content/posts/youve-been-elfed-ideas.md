However, some tips on how to make an idea into a successful business venture can help. 1) Start with a small goal: What are your main goals for the business?

But some researchers have come up with a new method that could help revolutionize how we think about the world around us. Their theory is called “Modularity” and it's based on the idea that everything is made up of tiny pieces. This means that everything can be broken down into its smallest parts, which can then be analyzed and understood more easily.
