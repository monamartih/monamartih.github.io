Creativedesigners are on the go, and that means they need to be creative when it comes to their work. Whether they're working from home or on the go, creativity is key to success. Here are four ways creative designers can keep their work organized and on track:

2. Use NiceNotes: Another great way to keep things organized is using NiceNotes. Not only do they look pretty, but they also have a variety of uses (such as for brainstorming).

The value of feedback: How important is it to get feedback on ideas before they are implemented?
Feedback is an important part of any business. It can help you make sure your ideas are a good fit for the company, and it can help you improve your products or services. But getting feedback on ideas before they're implemented can be just as important. If you don't get feedback, you could end up implementing something that's not really what you wanted or was hoping for. Feedback can also help you learn how to improve your business model and improve the way your products and services are delivered. It's worth getting it, whether it's through surveys or informal conversations with employees.
