The history of creativity: How has creativity evolved over time?
Creativity has been around for centuries, and it is no wonder that it has become so important in today’s society. In fact, creativity is often seen as one of the most underrated skills, as many people believe that creativity can only come from a certain type of mind. However, according to some researchers, creativity may actually be more common than we thought. In fact, creativity may even be more prevalent than originally thought. For example, research has shown that children as young as 2 years old are already capable of Civil War-era painting and poetry. And while many people believe that creativity comes from a “mental faculty” such as genius or IQ, this is not always the case. In fact, many people report feeling their creative juices flowing at an early age. So what is behind the resurgence of creativity?

what is innovation?
Innovation is the process of taking an idea and turning it into a reality. It can be something as simple as a new way to do something or a new product that solves a problem. Innovation is what allows us to progress as a society and make our lives better.
Without innovation, we would still be living in caves and eating raw meat. Innovation is what led to the creation of fire, which allowed us to cook food and stay warm. Innovation is also what led to the invention of the wheel, which made transportation much easier.

Innovation is not just about creating new things, but also about improving upon existing ideas. For example, the first cars were very crude and unreliable. But over time, through innovation, they became more reliable and efficient.

Innovation is essential for businesses to grow and compete in today’s global economy.
