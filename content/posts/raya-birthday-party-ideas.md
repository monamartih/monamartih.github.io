Origins and Development of Invention
Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea, or designing something that has never been done before. Invention can come from anything from ideas to products to even services. The key to any invention is to find a way to make it work and improve on what others have done before. Inventors are always looking for ways to make their inventions more effective, easier to use and less expensive.
