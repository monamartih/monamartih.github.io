The history of art: From prehistoric paintings to Post-Impressionism
Creative art has been around for as long as humans have been able to create. Prehistoric paintings and drawings depict everyday life and natural scenes, some dating back as early as 3,000 BC. Post-Impressionism was a movement in the late 19th century that aimed to update and renovate the French art movement of the 18th century. While many aspects of creative art have remained consistent over time, there are certain changes that can be seen in every genre.

Invention of the World Wide Web
In 1839, Nicholas-Jacques Conte wrote a paper on the idea of a world wide web, which would eventually be called the Internet. The first real steps were made in 1947 when Claude Shannon and others developed the theory of information theory, which allowed for the Transmission of Information over Communications Channels. The following year, IBM created an electronic computer called Punchy, which was used to test communication protocols on. In 1951, Xerox PARC developed the Alto computer system that could be connected to a network. On August 29th of that year, US president Harry Truman announced his plan to create the American National Telecommunications Commission (ANTC), which would control all federal telecommunications regulations. This was the beginning of what is now known as the Internet era.
