It is a process that includes many steps, from identifying a need or opportunity, to generating ideas, to testing and refining prototypes. Invention is often driven by necessity, but it can also be sparked by curiosity or a desire to improve upon existing solutions. Whether driven by necessity or curiosity, invention requires creative thinking, perseverance, and often a willingness to fail.
