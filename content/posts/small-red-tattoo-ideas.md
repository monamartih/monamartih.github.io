Safety basics for do-it-yourselfers: Every project has its own safety guidelines, so be sure to follow them carefully when planning and carrying out a DIY
If you're a do-it-yourselfer, be sure to follow safety basics when planning and carrying out projects. Here are a few tips:
1. Follow local safety guidelines: Many projects require special attention when done by yourself, such as building your own basement or installing a new roof. Cities with stricter safety regulations often have more specific safety guidelines that you must obey. Follow these rules to avoid potential injuries or worse.

2. Use common sense: When planning any project, always use common sense and take precautions before beginning. For example, don't try to fix something without first knowing how it works - this can lead to dangerous surprises down the road!

3. Get help if needed: If you need assistance with a project, don't hesitate to ask friends or family members for help. They may have experience and knowledge that you didn't consider.

Creative people are often seen as those who are able to come up with new and innovative ways to do things. However, this isn't always the case. In fact, some creativity comes from coming up with ideas that others may not even think of. Creative people can also be found in fields that are not typically associated with creativity such as fashion or interior design.

How to have big ideas
1. Want to have big ideas? You need to start by opening your mind. Be curious about the world around you and constantly ask yourself questions. Why does this happen? How could things be done better? When you're constantly challenging yourself to think differently, you'll start having bigger and better ideas.
2. It's also important to take risks. Don't be afraid to experiment and try new things, even if they seem a little crazy at first. The best ideas often come from thinking outside the box. So go ahead and let your imagination run wild!

3. Finally, don't forget to share your ideas with others. brainstorming with friends or colleagues can help you develop your ideas further and turn them into reality. So don't be afraid to speak up - your big idea could change the world!

Definition of innovation: How does it differ from other types of change?

Innovation often requires risk and creativity, and it can be difficult to predict which trends will lead to innovation and which won't.

What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything from new ways to cook, Tate Modern’s newest art gallery or a new way of travelling. Here are some of our favourites:
1. A creative way to relax: take a walk in nature. This can involve finding a meadow with plenty of trees, sitting under a tree and taking in the natural sounds.

2. Experiment with different food preferences: try out different recipes or eat something that you’ve never tried before. This will open your eyes to what foods you like and how they taste.

3. Get creative with your time: use up time by doing something creative like painting, drawing or sculpting. This will help you de-stress and get lost in thought for a little bit.
