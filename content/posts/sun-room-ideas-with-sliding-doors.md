The challenges of innovation
Every business wants to be innovative. But how do you go about being innovative when you're small and new? The challenges of innovation are just as extensive as the opportunities. Here are a few tips to help you navigate them:
1. Keep your ideas open. When you come up with a new idea, keep in mind that there's always room for improvement. You might not have initially thought of it this way, but if your idea is good enough, someone else might eventually come up with a better solution or an even better way to do things. Be open to suggestions and feedback from others before you give your idea any serious consideration.

2. Don't be afraid to take risks. When it comes time to come up with a new idea, don't be afraid to take on whatever challenge seems daunting or even impossible at first.

Creative thinking can help you solve problems
Creative thinking can help you solve problems. This isn't just a slogan, it's a law of the land. And if you're not using it, you're missing out on an opportunity to make some serious strides in your career and life. Here are four ways to get started: 
1. Take a break from reality: Try Problem-O-Maticity or The Break with Reality. These programs ask you to come up with five problems that challenge your current understanding of reality and then see how you can improve upon or even solve them. Afterward, take a few minutes to reflect on what came away from the session and how you would have tackled the first four problems. 

2. Make connections: What does creativity look like? What do different writers, artists, and thinkers share in common that makes them unique?
