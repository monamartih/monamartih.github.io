Tips for starting a DIY project: What do you need before beginning?
There are a few things you need before beginning your DIY project. These include a level, a hammer, screws, nails, and an armoire. Here are some tips to help you get started:
1. Level the surface area of the work surface to ensure accuracy.
2. Choose a Hammer that is the Right Size for Your Project. A larger hammer will be more powerful and will take more time to smooth out the surface of the wood. A smaller hammer may have better speed but will leave more marks on the wood.
3. Nail The Work Surface To The Wall or Floor First. This will prevent mess and make it easier to handle your project later on when nails are needed.
4. Screw The Work Surface To The wall or Floor After You nail it down (If using a floor).

Patent applications: What are the most common types of patent applications?
Patent applications are the single most common type of document filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). They account for about 60% of all patent filings, and they are also the most popular type of application.
There are many different types of patent applications, but three main types are: utility patents, design patents, and copyrights. Each has its own specific benefits and drawbacks, so it's important to understand which type is best for your product or idea.

 Utility patents are the most common type of patent application, and they're used to protect ideas that have no practical use yet but could be very beneficial in the future. For example, a company might file a utility patent for a new product that can help cut energy costs.

Design patents protect specific features or designs of products.
