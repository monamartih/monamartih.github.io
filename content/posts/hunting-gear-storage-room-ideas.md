Invention history: What inspired various inventors to come up with new ideas?
Invention history is a fascinating topic to explore, as it offers insights into the creativity and motivation behind inventors. Some of the most famous and influential inventors in history include Leonardo da Vinci, Nikola Tesla, Charles Darwin, and Marie Curie. Each inventor had their own unique ideas that led to new technologies and products. In some cases, these ideas were simply firsts – for example, da Vinci’s drawing of a three-dimensional image in paper was the first use of a technical drawing instrument in history. However, other inventions may have had more significant impacts on society or the economy. For example, Darwin’s theory of evolution led to the development of mass produced products like cars and machines. This theory also helped to change how people view themselves and their environment – thanks in part to his invention of the scientific method.

Discussion: What could we do to improve our idea process?
New ideas often come about during brainstorming sessions, and can be a great way to improve our idea process. However, it can be difficult to come up with new ideas on your own. Here are three tips on how to get started:
1. Get feedback from others: When brainstorming, it’s important to take input from other members of the team. This will help you develop ideas that are both based on common interest and workable.

2. Be open to change: sometimes the best ideas don’t fit into what we’ve been told before. Be willing to change your opinion if something seems better or more feasible.

3. Be persistent: despite sometimes being frustrating, nothing is more important than making sure our idea is implemented successfully. Keep at it until you have a great list of proposals that everyone is happy with!

It can be art in any medium, but often it is in the form of sculpture, painting, poetry, music, or architecture. Many people believe that creativity and art are two different things, but in truth, creativity and art are one and the same.

Origins of innovation: How has it been developed over time?
Innovation is a process that starts with a problem and then comes up with a creative solution to it. It is the result of creativity and the willingness to learn from your mistakes. Innovation is a key factor in economic growth, according to some experts. The history of innovation can be traced back to ancient Greece, where thinkers such as Socrates and Aristotle were fighting for ideas that would improve society. In China, the first written mention of innovation can be found in an account from the 3rd century BC written by Lu Cang. In Japan, it was only after Emperor Taishō made education compulsory in 1868 that people began to learn about innovation. In the 20th century, innovation was widely accepted by society and was considered part of the natural order of things. However, during World Wars II, there was a major shift in how innovation was viewed by both sides.
