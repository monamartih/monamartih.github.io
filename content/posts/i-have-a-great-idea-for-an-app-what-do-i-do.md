What is brainstroming?
What is brainstroming?
Brainstroming is a term used to describe the phenomenon of sudden, unexpected changes in thinking or behavior. It can be a result of a single event, such as seeing a new person or experiencing an unusual situation, or it can be more general and persistent.

There are several possible explanations for why brainstroming might occur. One theory is that the brain is working harder than usual to process information. Another theory suggests that the brain is using different strategies to solve problems, which has led to some unexpected changes in thinking. Still another theory suggests that the brain is trying too hard to understand something and isn't getting enough rest. Whatever the reason,brainstroming can lead to some surprising changes in thought and behavior.
