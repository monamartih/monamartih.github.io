1. To make money: Obviously, this is the main reason why people commercialize their invention ideas. If you have a great idea for a new product or service, you can make a lot of money by bringing it to market.

2. To change the world: Invention ideas have the potential to change the world for the better. By commercializing your idea, you can bring your vision to reality and make a positive impact on society.
