Why do we need to have big ideas?
There are a number of reasons why we need to have big ideas. 
1. Ideas can help solve problems. A big idea can be a solution to a problem that wasn't possible before. 
2. Idea generation can make us smarter. When we have ideas, we can learn from others and become better thinkers. 
3. Idea management is important for startups and businesses. Having a good idea is essential for any startup or business, as having too many ideas will lead to lower productivity and less success. 
4. Idea theft is a problem! Not everyone has the same idea for their business or product and someone else may have an idea that is better than your own and steal your idea without you realizing it. 
5. Idea culture is important for businesses!

The difference between creative and non-creative art: What makes one more creative than the other?
Creative art is often seen as something that is more "creative" than non-creative. This may be based on the individual's creative skills or simply their preferences. There are a few key elements to creative art, which can make it more creative than non-creative: 1) The artist has a passion for their work and feels an intense connection to it. This can be seen in the artist's eyes when they're creating, and it shows in their work as a whole. 2) The artist uses their creativity to explore new ideas, or come up with new ways of existing within the world. Non-creative artists may only focus on what they know, and may not explore any new ideas or different perspectives.

Conclusion: The benefits of brainstroming are vast and varied, and it can have a profound impact on people’s lives.
Brainstroming is a condition in which one’s thoughts and feelings are focused on a single topic. This can be beneficial for the individual, as it allows them to focus on their problem and come up with a solution. However, brainstroming can also have negative effects, depending on the person’s personality and mindset. If someone is brainstroming all the time, they may feel overwhelmed and alone. In addition, they may start to doubt themselves and their abilities.
