Creativity in the Workplace: Tips for staying creative in the workplace.
Creativity is key in the workplace. Here are some tips for staying creative in the workplace:
1. Start with the right ideas. It’s easy to come up with new ideas when you have fresh eyes and ears. If you don’t have any ideas, try to think of ways to improve your current work environment or products.

2. Be open to feedback. It can be difficult not to take feedback well, but it’s important that you do so in a constructive way. Feedback can help you develop new ideas and improve your work product.

3. Take breaks. Even though working long hours can be tiring, it’s important that you take breaks at least once every hour or so to relax and recharge your batteries.
