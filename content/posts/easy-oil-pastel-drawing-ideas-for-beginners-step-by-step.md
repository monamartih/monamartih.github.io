The Creative Process: How does one go about coming up with creative ideas?
Creative ideas can come from anywhere, but the creative process typically starts with an idea.

What are big ideas?
Big ideas are crucial to any startup or organization. They can provide the spark that ignites a new idea, or provide a way to focus on an existing problem and start solving it. By definition, big ideas are large enough to be considered as a serious possibility, but also small enough that they don’t disrupt or take over a company’s day-to-day operations. Here are three examples of big ideas that have helped startups and organizations grow:
1. Social media: A major driver of growth for startups is the ability to connect with customers on a personal level. By understanding how people use social media, companies can develop marketing strategies that work better for their target audience and create more engaging content.

2. Mobile app development: Another key element of growth for startups is creating innovative mobile apps that appeal to a wider range of users.
