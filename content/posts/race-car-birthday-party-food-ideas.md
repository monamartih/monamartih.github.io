Conclusion: What are some tips for coming up with creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything from coming up with a new concept for a business to coming up with a new design for a shirt. There are many creative ideas out there, but it can be hard to come up with the right one. Here are some tips to help you come up with the best ideas: 
1) Take some time to think about what you want your idea to say. What is your message? Are you trying to create something new or improve an existing product? If so, think about how you could make your idea more unique and interesting. 
2) Consider what others might want or need. Not all ideas should be based on what people might want or need. Sometimes, you can come up with an idea that is completely unrelated and still be effective. 
3) Be patient and don’t expect everything to happen at once.
