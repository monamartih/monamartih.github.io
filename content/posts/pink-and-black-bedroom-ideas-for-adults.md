Definition of creativity: Pixar's Bob Crandall said "Creativity is the ability to go beyond what you expected."
In an industry where creativity is often measured in terms of output, Pixar's Bob Crandall said that creativity is the ability to go beyond what you expected. This definition has helped the animation studio create some of the most innovative and groundbreaking films in history, including Toy Story, Finding Nemo, and Ratatouille.
