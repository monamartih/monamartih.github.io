The future of inventions: What needs to be done in order for new inventions to thrive?
Inventions have always been a part of humanity’s history, but as the world has become more complex, so too has the need for new inventions. This is especially true in today’s world, where technology is constantly evolving and becoming more advanced. In order for new inventions to thrive, however, there are several key things that need to be done. 
One of the most important things that needs to be done is to make sure that new inventions are passed on from one generation to the next. This can be done by creating a system where people can share ideas for new inventions with each other, and then testing and dubbing them into products or services. It also helps to create a market for these products or services by attracting investors who can help to bring these products or services to market quickly.

Top 5 Ideas to Start a Business: What are they?
1. Get a business idea. A business idea can come from anything that you think could be profitable or interesting. It doesn't have to be something you're already familiar with, either. Go online and search for phrases like "business ideas for young entrepreneurs" or "business ideas for people with disabilities."
2. Start a business with friends or family members. This is one of the best ways to get started because it's low-cost and easy. Ask your parents, your siblings, or your friends if they know anyone who might be interested in starting their own business. You can also start a business through a website or an online course.

3. Use the internet to find clients and clients' families.

Creativity can help you achieve success and stay creative. Here are a few tips to get started: 
1. Find an outlet for your creativity. When you have something to explore, creativity will flow freely. So find something that interests you and start writing or drawing inspiration from it. 
2. Connect with others like yourself. There is no secret to success if you want it - reach out to people who share your same interests and passions in order to get their ideas flowing. If all else fails, talking about your ideas with a friend or family member can be very helpful in inspiring new thoughts and ideas. 
3. Take the time to practice often. Practice makes perfect - so practice what you love most, no matter how difficult it may be to do so regularly (and don't forget- sometimes practice makes perfect).
