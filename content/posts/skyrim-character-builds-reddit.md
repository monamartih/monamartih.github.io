Conclusion: What advice would you give to someone interested in the future of technology?
There are a few things that anyone interested in the future of technology should keep in mind. One is to always be open to new ideas, and another is to think about what could happen if we don't take steps to improve the world around us. Here are a few ideas for future technology that might help address some of the problems we're seeing today:

-Augmented Reality: This allows users to see what they're looking at with more detail than ever before. Augmented Reality can also be used for marketing purposes, since it can give people an idea of what products they might want to buy.
