Idea for a big goal: What is our biggest goal?
Big goals are powerful tools for getting people to work together and achieve common goals. They can help a team focus on its mission, and create a sense of purpose. 
There are many different ways to create big goals, but here are five tips for creating effective ones: 

1. Start small: Big goals can be created relatively easily if the goal is something that the team is focused on and knows it has a chance of achieving. However, if the goal is something more difficult or time-consuming, it may be more difficult to get everyone together around it. Try starting with something that everyone in the team can understand and achieve. 

2. Break it down: Once the goal has been identified, break it down into smaller tasks that each team member can complete successfully.

What is the best way to organize your home?
There are many ways to organize a home, but one of the most popular and simple methods is to create a system where each room has its own individual category. This can help you focus on your career or other important responsibilities while still having plenty of space to relax and use your home as you please. Here are five tips on how to make this system work for you: 1) Create categories for bedrooms, living rooms, kitchen, family areas, and other areas in your home.

For example, if you have bedroom categories that include beds, walls, and chests of drawers, then they would be labeled Bedrooms, Walls, Drawers etc.
