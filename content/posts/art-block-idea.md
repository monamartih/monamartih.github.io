Benefits and Risks of Invention: What are the benefits and risks of an innovation?
Invention can be defined as the process of coming up with a new idea, product or service. There are many benefits to invention, ranging from creating new products and services to saving lives and improving the quality of life. However, there are also risks associated with innovation, including the risk of losing valuable technology or intellectual property. Here are four key Benefits of Invention: 
1) Innovation can create new opportunities for businesses and individuals. When a company comes up with a new product or service, it can now sell those ideas and products to other companies and consumers around the world. This creates economic opportunity for businesses and allows people to have more choices in what they eat, drink and wear. 

2) Innovation can help improve the quality of life for people around the world. Inventions can save lives by making it easier for people to get medical treatment or cure diseases.
