Innovation is the process of coming up with a new and better way to do something. It can come from anything, from ideas to products to services. Usually, innovation happens in companies, but it can also happen in individual people. Innovation can mean different things for different companies, but it’s always important to think about how it can be used to improve the company’s products and services.

what is an invention?
Invention is the process of creating something new, whether it’s a product, a process, or a service. It’s an important part of the business world, and it can be a lot of fun.
There are four main steps to inventing something: idea generation, development, prototyping, and commercialization. First, you have to come up with an idea for something new. This can be inspired by a problem you’ve noticed that needs solving, or by something you think would be cool or helpful to have. Once you have an idea, you need to develop it into a concept that can be turned into a physical product or service. This involves doing market research and feasibility studies to make sure your idea is viable and there’s demand for it.

What is creativity?
Creativity is a complex and subjective concept. Some people find it easy to see how creativity can be used in art, while others might not see any similarity at all between the creative process and their everyday lives. What is clear, though, is that creativity is something that everyone experiences differently and that there is no one way to approach it.
