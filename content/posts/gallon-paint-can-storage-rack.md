Conclusion
Concluding a brainstorming session can be just as important as starting one. Here are a few tips on how to effectively conclude a brainstorming session:
1. Thank everyone for their participation. This will help to foster a sense of team morale and keep people coming back to future sessions.

2. Summarize the main points that were discussed. This will help to ensure that everyone is on the same page and understands the goals of the session.

3. Choose one or two action items to focus on moving forward. This will help to keep the momentum going and ensure that progress is made on the goals that were set during the brainstorming session.

4. Assign someone to follow up on the action items. This will help to ensure that they get done in a timely manner and that everyone remains accountable for their part in achieving the goals.
