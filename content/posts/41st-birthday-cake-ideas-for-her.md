Creative expression: The creative act and the creative media
Creative expression is the process of coming up with new ideas, expressing them through creative means and then sharing these ideas with others. The creative act involves the individual’s thoughts, feelings and creativity as well as the medium through which they are expressed. The creative media includes both tangible and intangible forms, such as art, music, motion pictures and television. As we learn to express ourselves more creatively, we also learn to create more effectively in order to improve our businesses, relationships and lives.

How can you create a big idea?
Creating big ideas is a key part of any business. Here are a few tips to help you come up with your best ideas:
1.Think about what other businesses have done and how they’ve done it. What are their strategies, methods, or processes? This will give you a lot to work with when thinking about your own business.

2.Create an outline of your business idea and then break it down into smaller, more manageable chunks. This will help you focus on specific areas and make sure that each chunk is important for the whole business.

3.Make sure that your idea is realistic and achievable. If it seems impossible or like too much work, chances are you won’t even get started on it. Go with your gut feeling and see where the market takes you.

Conclusion: What does all this mean for artists today?
In the past few decades, creativity has become an increasingly popular word in the art world. This is mainly due to the rise of digital technology and its ability to allow for more creative expression.Today, artists have more opportunities than ever to express themselves through their work. However, there are some potential consequences of this newfound freedom that need to be considered.
One potential consequence is that people may no longer view artists as important or valuable members of society. This could lead to a decrease in patronage and investment from businesses and organizations that rely on creativity in their products or services. Additionally, it could prevent young people from learning about and learning from art as a form ofexpression.

Even though these consequences may be minor in comparison to other matters, they should be taken into account when making decisions about how best to support creative art today.
