Visual artists typically paint or sculpt while auditory artists listen to music or read book. While the two mediums have certain similarities, there are also significant differences that can make a difference in the way an artist creates their work.

Invention and Technology
Invention has always been a key component of technology. From fire starters to jetpacks, invention has helped people get the job done. But what happens when an invention is too good to be true? In some cases, this is where companies find themselves in a predicament. For example, the iPhone was initially thought to be a hoax because its creators couldn't find any evidence that it existed.
