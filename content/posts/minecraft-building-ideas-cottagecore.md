Definition of innovation: How does it differ from previous generations?
Innovation is the process of coming up with a new idea or product that is different from what has been done before. It can be classified into two main categories, incremental and revolutionary. Incremental innovation occurs in areas such as technology, business, and marketing; while revolutionary innovation occurs in areas such as science, medicine, and the environment. 
The definition of innovation has changing over time, but two main aspects have remained consistent: it should be creative, and it should be new to the market. Innovations should also be feasible to implement quickly and cost-effective. In order to achieve these goals, companies must have a clear understanding of how innovation works and how to define it narrowly or expansively according to their needs.

Innovation: How can new ideas be brought to market and be successful?
New ideas are one of the most important things that a company can bring to market. Successful companies have been able to develop new ideas that go beyond the standard and bring in new customers and profits. Here are some tips on how to bring your new idea to market:
1. Be prepared for rejection
One of the biggest challenges for any new idea is being rejected by those who have been familiar with your product or service before. This might be due to a lack of innovation, or it could be because your product is not yet available in an affordable price point. Regardless, make sure you are prepared to face rejection and continue working on your idea until it becomes a reality.

2. Be persistent
It takes a lot of hard work and perseverance to bring your idea to market. However, if you keep at it, you will eventually reach your goals.

Early Inventors and Inventions
Invention is a process of putting new ideas or objects into use. Inventions are often born out of necessity, as people try to solve everyday problems. But some inventions are created simply for the sake of novelty or fun. Early inventors made many important contributions to society, developing useful technologies that we still use today.
Some of the earliest known inventors include the Ancient Greek engineer Hero of Alexandria, who created the first steam engine, and Ctesibius, who invented the first water pump. In China, inventors developed paper and gunpowder in the 9th century. These inventions would have a profound impact on the world.

The Industrial Revolution saw a wave of new inventions that changed the way we live and work. Among these were the spinning jenny, which revolutionized textile production, and the steam engine, which powered factories and transportation.
