Idea #3:
Ideas are the bedrock of any successful enterprise. Whether you're starting a business, developing a new product, or simply trying to solve a problem, having a great idea is the first step.
But what makes a great idea? And how can you come up with one? Here are three key tips:

1. Look for problems to solve. A great idea usually comes from solving a problem. So if you're looking for an idea, start by identifying problems that need solving. This could be something as simple as making your daily commute more efficient, or it could be something more complex like developing a new treatment for cancer.

2. Brainstorm with others. Sometimes the best ideas come from collaboration. If you're stuck, try brainstorming with friends, family, or colleagues.

The challenges of coming up with big ideas
In any creative endeavor, there are always challenges to overcome. Whether it’s coming up with original ideas or finding your voice in a crowd of others, creativity is always a work in progress. And while some challenges can be easily resolved (such as coming up with a great slogan), others pose more difficult obstacles. Big Ideas are one such challenge, and while they can be easy to come by (just look at any popular blog or online article on the topic), they often require time and effort to put together into a successful product or business idea.
Despite the challenge, big ideas make for great products and businesses. They represent an innovative new way of thinking that can encourage change and spur innovation. And while big ideas can take time and effort to develop into something successful, they’re worth the investment.
