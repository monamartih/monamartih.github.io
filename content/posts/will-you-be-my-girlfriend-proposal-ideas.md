Economic analysis: What factors should you consider when developing an invention?
Invention ideas come in all shapes and sizes, from the seemingly simple to the incredibly complex. To make sure your invention is ripe for commercialization, you'll need to consider a variety of factors: cost, potential market demand, and other key considerations. Here are three tips to help you develop an idea that will be successful: 
1. Consider the costs of developing your invention. While it's important to come up with a reasonable price point for your product or service, don't forget about marketing and promotion costs – these can be significant expenses if you want your product to be successful. Look at how much money you think it would take to generate interest in your product or service and figure out how much marketing and promotional budget you'll need based on that information.

2. Consider potential market demand.

10 Ideas for a Clean and Lovely Home
1. Start with a cleanliness perspective. Cleaning up your home can be as simple as taking out the trash and putting away your clothes. Or, you could go all out and make a cleaning frenzy by hiring a professional to come out and clean everything from the ceilings to the toilet bowl. The point is, you can start small and gradually increase the frequency of yourcleanup as you become more comfortable with the idea of having a clean home.
2. Make room for organization. One of the most important aspects of having a clean home is making sure there are enough spaces to store your belongings. Whether it’s an attic or one of your downstairs rooms, make sure that you have enough storage space to accommodate all of your belongings. And, if possible, make use of wall-mounted shelves or racks for added organization.

3. Get organized yourself!
