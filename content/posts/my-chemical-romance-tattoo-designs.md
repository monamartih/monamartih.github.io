The importance of creativity in life: What should we do with it?
Creativity is one of the most important elements in life. It can help us think differently, come up with new ideas, and improve our productivity. However, sometimes creativity can get in the way of things we want to achieve. For example, some people may find it difficult to be creative when they're not used to thinking out loud or when they don't have a lot of experience with brainstorming. In order to keep creativity alive in our lives, we should be sure that we are constantly developing our skills and learning new ways to use it.
