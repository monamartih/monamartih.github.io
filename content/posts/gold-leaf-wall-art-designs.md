Creative brainstorming is a process of coming up with ideas that can help solve problems or achieve goals. It can be helpful to have a group of people who are familiar with the problem or goal in question and who can help you come up with potential solutions. One way to come up with creative ideas is to list the problem or goal, then list possible solutions that could work for the problem or goal. Other ways to come up with ideas include asking others for their suggestions, looking at examples of how other people have solved similar problems, and using your own creativity to come up with new ideas.

Definition of creativity: How does it differ from other forms of creative expression?
Creativity has been defined in many ways over time, but there is one common thread that runs through all of them: creativity is a process. In order to be creative, you have to be open to change and new ideas. This opens up the door for all sorts of possibilities, from the simple to the complex.
To put it another way, creativity is not just thinking outside the box; it's also feeling out new ideas and coming up with new ways to express yourself. It can be hard to maintain this level of energy for long, but with a little bit of effort and dedication, you can make your creativeexpression thrive.

Stimulating creativity with prompts:
When it comes to creativity, there are a variety of ways to get those ideas flowing. One way is to use prompts. Prompts can help to stimulate the creative process by providing a structure or framework within which to generate ideas.
There are a number of different types of prompts that can be used, depending on what you’re looking to achieve. For example, if you’re looking for ideas for a new project, you might use a prompt that asks you to come up with three possible options for what that project could be.

If you’re struggling with writer’s block, on the other hand, you might use a prompt that gives you a specific topic or scenario to write about. The key is to find a prompt that works for you and your current needs.
