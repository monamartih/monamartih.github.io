Trends in Health care
Healthcare is a constantly changing field, with new technologies and practices emerging every day.  In 2020, the global healthcare industry is expected to experience significant growth due to growing population sizes, various diseases, and increasing health demand. Ideas for how to capitalize on this growth are manifold, but one key trend that will be important in shaping the future of healthcare is the rise of virtual reality (VR).

creating: How do you create ideas?
Creative ideas are a key part of any successful business. By understanding how to create and use creative ideas, you can improve your chances of success. Here are some tips to help you get started:
1. Come up with a specific idea. One of the most important things to do when creating creative ideas is to come up with a specific goal that you want to achieve. This will help you focus on what needs to be done instead of thinking about every possible option.

2. Look for inspiration. When looking for inspiration, don’t just look at things that have already been done or that have been popular in the past. Check out those that have gone above and beyond in order to get an idea of what you could do yourself (and make sure you avoid copying anyone!).

3. Be flexible.

The definition of creativity: What does it mean to be creative?
Creativity is the ability to produce new ideas or solutions that are unique and different from those that have been produced before. This may be seen as a natural talent or an acquired skill, but it is still creativity if it is used in an original way. The definition of creativity has changed over time, but the essentials remain the same: creativity involves using your own mind and imagination to come up with new ideas or solutions.

Trends in artificial intelligence (AI): What new sources of AI will we see in the next few years?
AI is becoming more and more pervasive in our daily lives, with a number of startups and companies working on various AI projects. Some of the most important trends that are expected to take place in the next few years include:
1. More automated intelligent agents – This trend is already being seen in some industries, such as retail, where machines are increasingly able to carry out tasks that used to be carried out by human beings. The hope is that this will eventually lead to increased efficiency and savings for businesses.

2. Machine learning – This field is rapidly developing and has the potential to change many aspects of our lives, from business to healthcare.

Brainstroming: How does it work?
How do brains work? There is no one answer to this question as the workings of the brain are complex and still being studied by scientists today. But, according to some theories, brainstroming may play a role in some aspects of mental activity. Brainstroming is when thoughts or ideas rush through your mind quickly and without any thought process behind them. This can lead to a lot of thinking and problem solving in a short amount of time. In some cases, brainstroming can be helpful for quick bursts of creativity or for focusing on a task at hand. However, it can also be dangerous if used too frequently or without proper moderation. So, how does brainstroming work? Scientists don’t really know for sure, but some theories suggest that it involves the release of chemicals from your brain in order to help you process information more quickly.

Creativity and art: What are the benefits?
