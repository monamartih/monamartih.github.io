Definition of innovation:
Innovation is the process of bringing new ideas or products to market using creative and efficient methods. Innovation can be found in any industry, but typically it refers to technology, business, and product innovation.
There are many ways to define innovation, but one way that has become increasingly important is the definition provided by Matt Ridley in his book "The Innovator's Dilemma." Ridley defines innovation as a state of mind: "Innovation always means change, not just alteration of what has been done before." He goes on to say that innovation should be based on the following four factors: creativity, efficiency, novelty, and sustainability.

Creativity is a necessary component of any innovation process; without it, ideas will likely not make it past the initial stages of development.

Innovation in healthcare: What new technologies are coming soon?
The healthcare industry is constantly developing new technologies to improve the quality and efficiency of care. Some of these innovations are coming soon, while others may still take some time to develop. Here are two examples of the latter. 
One technology is called "smart technology." This refers to devices that are specifically designed to improve patient care, such as providing real-time alerts or tracking patient vital signs. This can reduce the amount of time patients spend on their chart, make it easier for nurses to find needed medical supplies and personnel, and ensure that patients receive the best possible care. 

The other innovation is called "telemedicine." This refers to delivery of medical care over the Internet or other digital platforms. telemedicine has the potential to revolutionize healthcare by cutting costs and increasing efficiency.
