Types of innovation:
Innovation is the process of producing a new product, service, or idea that uses existing technology. Innovation can come from a variety of sources, such as creativity, innovation, and risk-taking. 
One of the most common types of innovation is using technology to improve the quality of life for people. For example, Apple has developed technologies that make it easier for people to communicate with one another and make more efficient use of their time. 

Innovation can also come from cutting-edge research and development. This type of innovation often creates new products or services that are not possible with the current technology. For example, Google’s Nexus series devices allow users to access new apps and features without having to worry about getting your hands on an outdated model. 

There are many different types of innovation that can be successful in different industries.
