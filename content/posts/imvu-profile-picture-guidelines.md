Idea 1: Share your life story
If you've been married for 10 years, or longer, you know that sharing your life story is a tradition. It's a way to show people that you're committed to them and appreciate them. But what if sharing your life story doesn't feel like it's important to you? What if it feels like a chore?
That's where ideas come in. In order to feel more fulfilled in our lives, we need to focus on what truly matters. So why not share your life story with someone who mattersthrough those experiences? Why not tell them everything about your marital status, your job history, and all of the little things that make up your day-to-day?

It'll give them a currency of understanding and appreciation. Plus, they might be inspired by how much you appreciate them themselves... which is always an added bonus!

Overcoming blocks: what to do when you can't think of anything
When you sit down to write and nothing comes to mind, it can be frustrating. But don't worry, there are things you can do to overcome this block.
First, try to relax. Take a deep breath and remind yourself that it's okay if you can't think of anything right now. It happens to everyone. Just take a break for a few minutes and come back later.

If relaxation doesn't work, try brainstorming. Write down any ideas that come to mind, no matter how silly they may seem. Once you have a list of ideas, you can start narrowing them down and developing them further.

If all else fails, talk to someone else about your project. Sometimes it helps to hear someone else's perspective on what you're trying to write about. They might have some good ideas that you can use.

Impact of innovation on society and economy:
Innovation is an ever-growing movement in the economy that leads to new products, services and businesses. It is also a key factor in society; innovations often lead to changes in social norms and the way people interact. The impact of innovation on society and economy has been studied for many years and there are some clear conclusions about what types of innovation have the biggest impact. 
One clear conclusion is that innovative activity can have a significant positive impact on society if it meets three conditions: it should be done in a way that does not harm others, it should be affordable for everyone, and it should be able to create jobs. However, even when innovations meet these conditions, they can still have a negative impact on society if they do not meet other specific requirements.
