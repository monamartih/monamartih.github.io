what is creative art?
Creative art is a type of art that is open to interpretation. It can be anything from painting and sculpture, to music and dance. Creative art is about expressing yourself and your ideas, in a way that is unique to you.
There are no rules or guidelines to creative art, which is what makes it so special. It is a way for you to express yourself freely, without having to conform to anyone else’s standards.

Creative art can be a great outlet for emotions and feelings that you may not be able to express in words. It can be therapeutic, and help you to connect with your inner thoughts and feelings.

Definition of creativity: What makes something creative?
Creativity is the ability of an individual to think outside the box and come up with new ideas or solutions to problems. It can be found in any form, from creative writing to architectural design. To many, creativity is seen as a verb, meaning that someone does something creative in order to produce something new. However, for some, creativity stems from the act of thinking, rather than doing. This definition of creativity is flexible and can be used for any type of artistic work.

What is the creation process like?
Invention ideas are something that often come to people by surprises. They may be something that someone has been thinking about, or something that they were inspired by. The creation process is a crucial part of any invention, and can play a major role in how successful the invention is. There are many different steps involved in the creation process, and each one has its own importance. 
The first step is always brainstorming. This can be done either before or after the idea has been finalized. It is important to get rid of any bad ideas before they become a part of the product. This will help to make sure that the product is truly unique and innovative. Once an idea has been brainstormed, it needs to be tested. This can be done in many ways, but the most important part is to find a way that the product can be used in reality.
