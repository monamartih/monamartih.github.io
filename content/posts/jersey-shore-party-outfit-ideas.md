What are the different types of ideas?
Ideas are an important part of any plan or project. They can be as small as a thought or as large as a goal that needs to be achieved. There are many different types of ideas, but here are four that stand out the most:

The power of suggestion
Creative ideas are the key to any business or project. When you have a good idea, it's easy to set out to find someone who can help turn that into a reality. Whether you're looking for help with your creative vision or just some recommendations for new companies or products, giving people the opportunity to suggest ideas is one of the most important tools you have in your toolbox.
There are a few things you need in order to give people the opportunity to suggest ideas: first, an idea must be something that someone really wants and desires. Second, it needs to be something that they think could benefit others. And finally, it needs to be something that they think would be interesting and potentially useful for your project or business.

Methodology: How will we test and measure the results?
Testing and measuring the results is an important step in any business. It allows you to know how your product or service is performing and whether it is meeting your expectations. There are many different ways to test and measure the results of a business, but one common approach is to use surveys. Surveys can be used to measure customer satisfaction, abandon rates, and more.
There are a few factors you should consider when choosing a survey technique. For example, do you want to target specific demographics? Or do you want to gather data from a large number of people? Finally, will you be able to release the results publicly? If so, public Release Testing (PRT) may be the best technique for you. PRT allows you to release your findings as soon as possible after testing so that everyone can see what worked and what didn’t.
