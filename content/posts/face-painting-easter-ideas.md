Why do we need to have big ideas?
There are a number of reasons why we need to have big ideas. 
1. Ideas can help solve problems. A big idea can be a solution to a problem that wasn't possible before. 
2. Idea generation can make us smarter. When we have ideas, we can learn from others and become better thinkers. 
3. Idea management is important for startups and businesses. Having a good idea is essential for any startup or business, as having too many ideas will lead to lower productivity and less success. 
4. Idea theft is a problem! Not everyone has the same idea for their business or product and someone else may have an idea that is better than your own and steal your idea without you realizing it. 
5. Idea culture is important for businesses!

What are some of the most common pitfalls when it comes to new ideas?
New ideas are always risky, so it’s important to be aware of some of the most common pitfalls when it comes to coming up with them. These include: not being able to see the potential positives, overestimating how much work is required, failing to anticipate resistance from others, and underestimating how much feedback is needed before anything can be put into practice. If you’re ever feeling lost when it comes to creating new ideas, take a step back and think about what worked for others before you try something new.
