What are big ideas?
Big ideas are always something to think about and consider as you go about your day-to-day life. Whether it’s coming up with a new idea for a product or service, or thinking of ways to make your business more efficient, big ideas are always important to consider. Here are some of the most popular big ideas around these days:
1. Start your own business: This is an option that many people take on because they feel like they don’t have a lot of options available to them. The cost of starting your own business can be low, and there are many resources available online if you need help getting started. There is also the added benefit of not having anyone else telling you what to do.

The history of AI: How has AI been developed over the years?
A key part of any AI development is understanding the motivations behind the work. This history can be broken down into three periods: the1950s, 1970s, and 1980s. The 1950s were a time when AI was in its early developmental stages; however, it wasn’t until the 1960s that advancements began to occur in machine learning. However, this progress was slowed by two factors: the Cold War and concerns about how AI could be used for harm. The 1970s saw significant advancements made in AI; however, these advances were met with backlash from some quarters as they were seen as being too advanced for their time. The 1980s saw a shift towards using AI for good; however, this shift was met with criticism from some who felt that AI had become excessive in its power.
