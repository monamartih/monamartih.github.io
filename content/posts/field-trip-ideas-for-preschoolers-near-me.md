The Use of Invention: What are some examples?
Invention is the use of a creative idea, or a new method or process, to produce a product or service. Invention can come from anywhere: in your mind, in your backyard, on the internet, or even from someone you know. 
There are many examples of invention. For example, think about the wheel- an invention that changed the way we move around. There are also inventions that have had huge impacts on society and the world like the telephone, antibiotics, and jet engines- all of which were invented by people who were not just working on their own but were part of a team. 
Inventions can be really amazing or really terrible. But they always have a big impact because they help us do things that we couldn't do before and they make our lives easier.

Eco-Friendly Home Improvements: How can you make your home more eco-friendly?
Eco-friendly home improvements are easy to make if you take the time to think about what you need and want. Here are a few ideas to help make your home more eco-friendly:
1. Make sure your heating and cooling system is eco-friendly. Not only will this save you money in the long run, but it can also help improve your environment by reducing emissions from your home.

2. Use recycled materials in your construction. When building or repairing your home, be sure to use recycled materials whenever possible. This not only saves you money in the long run, but it also helps reduce environmental impact on both of our planet’s inhabitants and future generations.

3. Use rainwater tanks rather than water systems that use water fluoridation products.
