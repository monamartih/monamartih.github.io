Ideas 1-4:
Ideas 1-4 are a set of ideas that could be used to help plan for the future. These ideas can be used in different situations, so it is important to think about what they would mean for the individual and their business. Some of these ideas include:
1. Creating a plan – This could involve sketching out what the future looks like, as well as what steps need to be taken in order to achieve it. This will help identify any areas where growth could be made and identify any potential risks. 
2. Working on projects – This could involve developing new products or services, or expanding an existing one. It can also involve working on a project that is long-term, rather than just focusing on the present. 
3. Finding new ways to make money – This could involve starting a business or finding new sources of revenue.

How can you come up with big ideas?
Big ideas are important when it comes to coming up with new ideas, but they can also be a challenge. There are a few things you can do to help come up with big ideas that will be successful.
