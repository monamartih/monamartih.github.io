The science of creativity: what makes an idea creative?
Creativity is the ability to come up with new ideas. It is a skill that can be learned and developed. There are several factors that contribute to creativity.
One of the most important factors is motivation. A creative person is usually motivated by a problem or challenge. They are not afraid of failure and are willing to take risks. They are also open to new ideas and willing to experiment.

Another important factor is knowledge. A creative person has a deep understanding of their field and is able to see things from different perspectives. They are also able to make connections between disparate ideas.

Lastly, creativity requires a certain mindset. A creative person is usually open-minded, flexible, and receptive to change. They are also able to think outside the box and see things in new ways.

Ideas are a dime a dozen these days, and many people are unsure of what to do with them. Some people think that new ideas are just to be tossed aside because they're not good enough, while others believe that there might be some great benefits to implementing a new idea. Here are three examples of why you might want to give a new idea a try: 
1. You may find an interesting application for the idea that you've been thinking about for years but never had the time or energy to pursue. 
2. You may have come up with an innovative way of doing something that has never been done before, and now it can be your go-to solution for any problem you face. 
3. An idea that is completely unique and has no equal on the market right now could lead to some really big changes in your industry or business.
