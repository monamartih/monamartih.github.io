The history of invention: from the ancient Egyptians to the Wright brothers
Invention ideas have been around for centuries, and it is no wonder that they continue to be a part of our daily lives today. From ancient Egyptians to the Wright brothers, some inventions have had a lasting impact on society and the world. Here are five examples:
1) The wheel was invented by the ancient Egyptians, who used it to move goods around their cities.

2) The telescope was invented by Johannes Kepler in 1611, which allowed him to see things that were previously impossible to see.

3) The telephone was invented by Samuel Morse in 1876, which allowed people to communicate with one another without having to speak directly.

4) The computer was invented by Charles Babbage in 1871, which allowed people to create new ways of doing calculations.

Are there any dangers associated with coming up with new ideas?
Ideas can be a great way to get people thinking, but there are always some dangers associated with them. One danger is that people may not take the time to think through the implications of the idea before they come up with it. Another danger is that people may not be able to see the potential for the idea to work, and may instead just create something without any real thought or planning. Finally, ideas can also be dangerous if not properly executed. If someone comes up with an idea that does not have a lot of potential or if it does not involve anything original, then it can lead to a lot of problems.
