There are many ways to track fitness progress and calories burned, but one popular way is to use a pedometer. A pedometer tracks steps taken and the number of calories burned, which can be helpful in understanding how much exercise you're doing and how much weight you've lost. Another common way to track fitness progress is to use a Garminbrace. This tracking device records your physical activity data and stores it on a computer. You can then see your average caloric burn for each day or week, as well as your overall progress over time.
