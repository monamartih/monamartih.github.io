Ideas as fuel for creativity: why you need them and how to use them
Creativity is a precious commodity and it can be hard to find the right ideas to help you get started. Here are 5 ways to use creativity to fuel your creativity:
1. Get inspired by other people or objects. view images of famous landmarks, paintings, sculptures, or even everyday items and come up with creative ideas for them.

2. Find a problem that you’re struggling with and solve it using creative thinking. This can be anything from coming up with a new design for a product to coming up with an idea for a restaurant that sells healthy food.

3. Take advantage of your natural creativity by brainstorming problems that don’t have an easily solved solution. This could include ideas for new products, products that are harder to find, or even ideas for new business concepts.

The Power of Ideas: Why having a good idea is important.
There's no doubt that having a good idea is important. Ideas are the lifeblood of any business or organisation - without them, you simply wouldn't have anything to offer customers or clients. But what makes a good idea? And how can you make sure that your ideas are as strong as they can be?
A good idea needs to be original and relevant to your target audience. It should also be something that you're passionate about, as this will help you to sell it and get others on board with it. Finally, it's worth considering whether your idea is feasible and practical - if it's not, then it might not be worth pursuing.

If you've got a great idea, then don't be afraid to share it with others.
