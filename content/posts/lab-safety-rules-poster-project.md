Creative ideas are always a great source of inspiration. However, when it comes to prioritizing them, there can be some tricky business.

What is an invention?
There is no one definitive definition of an invention, but most Americans would likely say that an invention is a new product, process, or service.  Inventors often work on their inventions for years before they finally create a product or service that people can use. 
There are many different types of inventions, but some common ones include technological advances like the Telephone, Telegraph and Radio Act of 1847 (TCR), which gave us the ability to talk to each other over the air; and health advances such as aspirin and insulin in the 1800s. 

Inventions can have a profound impact on society and the economy. For example, TCR allowed for easier travel and communication across country boundaries. This made it possible for people from all corners of the world to meet and share ideas. Similarly, insulin helped people with diabetes control their medications more effectively.

The scientific and technological revolutions: What did these change about the definition of invention?
Invention is a definition that has been in use for centuries. However, during the last two hundred years, there have been several technological revolutions that have redefine what it means to be an inventor. The first of these was the introduction of the machine gun in the late eighteenth century. This change in technology allowed armies to fight on a much larger scale and made war possible for the first time. The second revolution was the development of computers in the late twentieth century. This change in technology allowed scientists and doctors to interface with each other on a much more personal level and permitted them to create new medical cures and treatments. These technological changes have had a significant impact on society and economy, and have led to new ideas about how invention works.
