Creative ideas are always a great way to come up with new ideas and improve current ones. Here are a few ideas that may help you get started:
1. Create a new project or idea. This can be anything from designing a new shirt to coming up with a new business model. Just be sure that your idea is both innovative and feasible, as there is no guarantee that it will be accepted.

2. Take on an existing project. If your idea isn’t very different from what someone else has already done, it might be worth considering taking on an existing project. This can give you some experience and knowledge in the area in which you want to focus your efforts, as well as the support of other people who might have an expertise in that area.

3. Try out different methods ofexpression.

Invention process: How does an invention happen?
Invention ideas are a process that starts with a thought and progresses to the creation of a new product or service. The invention process can be described in four steps: Pre-production, Production, Market saturation, and Post-market.
Pre-production is when the inventor creates a rough idea of what they want their product or service to look like. This might include sketches, prototypes, or models.

Production is when the inventor makes the actual product or service. This might involve manufacturing it in physical form, shipping it to customers, and selling it.

Market saturation is when the public has become so familiar with the new product or service that they are willing to buy it. This might require creating more versions of the product or service, marketing them well, and making sure they are available at low prices.

What are some common creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything from new ways of looking at an old problem to reinventing the wheel. Here are five creative ideas that come to mind when thinking about creative ideas: 
1. Use discarded materials to create something new. For example, if you have a bunch of old cereal boxes lying around, go through them and discard any that are too large or bulky to use. Once you’ve eliminated the big ones, start stacking these in different positions to see what kind of shapes and designs emerge.
2. Try a new approach to an existing idea. If you’ve been using the same recipe for years, try using a different type of flour or sugar in your baking recipes. This will give your baking recipes a bit of a fresh start and make them more delicious overall.
3. Take advantage of unused space.
