What are some common problems that come with big ideas?
There are a number of common problems that come with big ideas, including: 1) not knowing how to conceptualize and execute them; 2) not knowing what to do with positive feedback when it's available; and 3) not being able to focus on the bigger picture. If you're struggling with any of these issues, here are some tips to help you overcome them: 
1) Draw on your own personal experience or experiences from others in order to understand what works for them. This will help you gain a better understanding of how your idea can be executed. 
2) Take a step back and analyze your idea in terms of its overall goal rather than just individual goals. This will help you figure out whether or not it's worth pursuing. 
3) Don't be afraid to ask for help when it comes time to execute your idea.

How to brainstorm effectively
In order to brainstorm effectively, it is important to keep an open mind and be willing to think outside the box. Creativity is key when brainstorming, so try not to get too bogged down in the details. Instead, focus on coming up with creative solutions to the problem at hand. It can also be helpful to bounce ideas off of others in order to get different perspectives. Brainstorming sessions should be lively and fun - so don't be afraid to let your imagination run wild!
