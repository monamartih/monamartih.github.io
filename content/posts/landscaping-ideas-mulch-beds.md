The creative process: How does the creative process work?
Creative ideas come to life when artists and writers share their thoughts, feelings and experiences with one another. The creative process begins with inspiration, which is the first step in developing a creative idea. Next, the artist or writer must come up with a unique concept that will capture the attention of others. Once the idea has been captured, it’s time for the writer or artist to flesh out the idea into a full-blown story or novel. Finally, unless there’s an incredible lucky streak, every book or story has to be well-researched and Fallon writes about creating new ideas on a daily basis - whether that’s coming up with an original character or imagining what might happen if she were ever given the opportunity to work on a project her own choosing.

History of inventions: How have inventions been made over time?
Inventions have been made for centuries, but it is only recently that there has been a concerted effort to collect and study these inventions. Many of the most amazing and influential inventions have come about through collaboration between multiple individuals or teams. Here are four examples of how inventions have been made over time:

1) The telephone – This invention was first developed in 1876 by Alexander Graham Bell and his partner Samuel Morse. They designed a talking telephone which could be used to communicate with one another.

2) The electric light bulb – This invention was first developed in 1879 by George Stephenson and John Wise. They created a device that could be plugged into an electrical outlet and use electricity to produce light.

3) The air-purifier – This invention was first developed in 1919 by Maynard Kelleher and Clifford Berry.
