Creative Process: What goes into creative thinking?
Creative thinking is the process of coming up with new and innovative ideas. It can be difficult to know where to start, but here are a few tips to get started: 
1. Be open to new ideas: When you're brainstorming for new ideas, be willing to change your mind a lot. If you're not sure what something could be, give it a try. You may find that something you thought was impossible is actually possible. 

2. Be persistent: Don't give up on your ideas just because they seem hard or too risky. Keep trying until you come up with something that works and that you're satisfied with. This can take time and effort, but it's worth it in the end!

Tips for starting a DIY project: What do you need before beginning?
There are a few things you need before beginning your DIY project. These include a level, a hammer, screws, nails, and an armoire. Here are some tips to help you get started:
1. Level the surface area of the work surface to ensure accuracy.
2. Choose a Hammer that is the Right Size for Your Project. A larger hammer will be more powerful and will take more time to smooth out the surface of the wood. A smaller hammer may have better speed but will leave more marks on the wood.
3. Nail The Work Surface To The Wall or Floor First. This will prevent mess and make it easier to handle your project later on when nails are needed.
4. Screw The Work Surface To The wall or Floor After You nail it down (If using a floor).

2. Come up with specific examples of how your goal can be accomplished using common methods and resources. This will give you a deep understanding of what is required and make the process easier.

3. Brainstorm with other people on how best to achieve your goal using their expertise and resources.

What makes a good idea?
Ideas are important, but they also come with risk. If your idea is too risky, it won’t get traction and may never see the light of day. That’s why it’s essential to be sure your idea is worth taking on. There are a few key principles that help make an idea a good one: It should be something people want or need; it should be novel and have potential to change the world; it should have a commercial Potential; and it should be feasible to execute. Here are three examples of ideas that researchers at Imperial College London say might just be worth pursuing: 
1. A contact lens that records what you see When contact lenses become more prevalent, many people will likely want to know what they’re looking at. This could lead to new ways for seeing the world and improving safety for everyone involved.
