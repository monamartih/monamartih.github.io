The Relationship of Invention to Technology: What makes an invention useful?
Invention is the process of creating a new product or service from scratch. However, Invention can also bedefined as the creation of a new way of doing something, whether it’s in the realm of technology or business. Inventions have revolutionized how we live, work and interact with the world around us. They have also allowed for advancements in technology that we could never have thought possible. 
However, there are a few things to keep in mind when it comes to Invention. First, Invention has to be useful- if it’s not, it won’t be adopted by society as quickly as some inventions have. Second, Invention has to be affordable- if it’s too expensive or difficult to create a working prototype, people will not adopt it.

The role of innovation in the economy: How do businesses use it?
Innovation is a key ingredient in the success of businesses. It allows businesses to continuously improve their products and services, which leads to increased profits and better customer service. However, innovation can also be a cost-effective way for businesses to increase their chances of success. For example, Google was founded on the idea that search engines could be improved so that people would find more information faster. By continually improving its search engine, Google became one of the most successful businesses in history. Likewise, Apple was once considered a startup company with little chance of success because its products were not innovative. But because it invested in research and development, Apple was able to create some of the most popular devices in history such as the iPhone and iPad. Innovation is essential to business success and can play a major role in helping companies reach new heights.
