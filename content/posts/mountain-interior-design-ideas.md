The definition of brainstroming: how it works and what it can do for you
There are many definitions of brainstroming, but the most complete one I’ve found is this: “the process by which a person or organization achieves a goal by using whatever resources they have at hand, including their own brainpower and energy.” Brainstroming can be used for personal or professional purposes. For example, if you want to improve your thinking skills, you may use brainstroming to do so. If you want to become more organized, you may use brainstroming to help with that. And if you want to achieve a goal faster, you may use brainstroming to help with that as well.
