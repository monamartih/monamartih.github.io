The Idea: 1. What are some big ideas?
There are a few big ideas out there when it comes to starting a business. Here are some of the most prominent:
1. Start small and grow large. This is one of the most important things to remember when starting a business. You don't have to be the biggest or best in the world just start something and see where it takes you.
2. Be passionate about what you do. If you're not passionate about your work, no one else will be either. This is something that will come with time and experience, but start off by putting your all into your startup and showing people that you're really into it.
3. Have repeat customers/clients come back for more.

Origins of Invention: What inspired people to invent?
Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea, method or product that has not been invented before. It can be something as simple as coming up with a new way to make bread dough, or developing a new agricultural technology. In some cases, Invention can even come from scratch – someone comes up with an idea for a product and starts production. There are many sources of Inspiration for Invention, and it can come from anywhere in the world.
There are several reasons why people might come up with an Invention. Sometimes people have an Idea because they are frustrated with their current situation, or they see an opportunity that they haven't seen before. Sometimes Invention comes about because of observing others in their environment and noticing how they solve problems.
