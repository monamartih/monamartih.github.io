Elements of grammar: What is a sentence, and how does it work?
A sentence is an individual unit of communication. It is a group of words that are put together to create a thought or statement. They come in all shapes and sizes, but they all share one key feature- they are all complete sentences. There are two main types of sentence- the opening sentence, and the closing sentence. The opening sentence is the beginning of a piece of text, and it sets the tone for the rest of the story. The closing sentence is the end of a piece of text, and it summarizes what has happened so far. There are many different ways to build a sentence, but all preserves these common features: Each word must be completed with a letter from A to Z, and there must be an ending consonant after every other letter. There are also certain rules that govern how words can be spelled- these rules are called grammar rules.
