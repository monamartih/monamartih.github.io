10 must-do projects when you renovation your home
1. Start with the basics: before you start any renovation project, make sure you have everything you need in order to complete it successfully. This includes a contractors license, permits, and a home builder’s manual.
2. Begin by taking a look at your home’s interior: this will give you an idea of what needs to be done in order to update or renovate it. Check out Pinterest or online search engines for images of homes that have been renovated in recent years.

3. Get started on your foundation: this will help you determine the size, shape, and style of your new home. Be sure to find out what kind of mortar and contact cement are used in order to prevent moisture infiltration and other problems.
