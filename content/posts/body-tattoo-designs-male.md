Conclusion: the importance of creativity in our lives
When it comes to creativity, we often think of artistic pursuits like painting or writing.  However, creativity is so much more than that. It’s about thinking outside the box, coming up with new ideas and solutions, and looking at the world in a different way.
In our fast-paced, constantly changing world, creativity is more important than ever. We need to be able to adapt and come up with new ideas to solve problems. If we get stuck in the same way of thinking, we’ll never progress.

So next time you’re feeling stuck, don’t give up. Take a step back and look at the situation from a different perspective. You never know what creative solution you might come up with.

The Future of Work: What needs to be done to keep people employed?
There is no doubt that the future of work is fraught with uncertainty. There are many reasons for this, but one big factor is the increasing use of technology. The way that technology affects work and jobs is changing constantly, so it's important to keep up with the latest trends. Some ideas that could help to keep people employed include: 
1) More job flexibility – as technology advances, it becomes easier and more affordable for people to change their working hours or locations whenever they feel like it. This means that there are more opportunities for people to work from home, which can be a great way to stay on top of your schedule and stay organized. 
2) Better communication between employers and employees – not everyone needs the same level of communication when it comes to working with their boss.
