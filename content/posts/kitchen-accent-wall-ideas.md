Invention process: How do inventors create new ideas?
Invention processes vary depending on the type of invention, and how new ideas are created. Some common methods include brainstorming, R&D, and ideation. Inventors often use different methods to create new ideas.
 brainstorming is a process where inventors come up with new ideas by thinking about what they don't know. The inventors can use any tool to help them come up with new ideas- such as paper, pencils, or a computer.

R&D is another name for brainstorming. It involves researching what other people have done and finding potential problems that could be solved by using a certain idea. This can take place in the form of studies or prototypes.

Ideation is another way to create new ideas. It's when inventors think about things that have never been thought of before and come up with possible solutions to problems.

The creative process: How do you come up with creative ideas?
Creative ideas come from a variety of places within the individual. They can come from inspirations, ideas stemming from one's own life experiences, or even just things that strike the individual as fun or interesting. 
There are a few key things that go into creating creative ideas. The first is to have some sort of starting point. This can be anything from an idea for a project to inspiration for your next painting or poem. Once you've got your idea down, it's important to further refine it and create something tangible out of it. 

Once you've created something that you're happy with, it's time to start working on turning it into a reality. This involves coming up with ways that you can make your idea more effective and efficient in terms of execution.
