Ideas that work: What makes a good idea successful?
Ideas that work have a clear path to fruition and are able to be scaled up or down as needed. They also have a sense of humor, which can make them relatable and fun to follow. Here are six ideas that have been successful in the past:
1. Create a website – A website is one of the most important tools an entrepreneur has. It allows potential customers to learn more about your product or service, and it can help you build a following. A well-designed website is easy to navigate, provides useful information on your product or service, and looks professional.

2. Develop an app – App development is another popular idea that has been successful in the past. An app allows users to do something specific, such as ordering food or shopping for products online, without having to visit multiple websites or go through customer service.
