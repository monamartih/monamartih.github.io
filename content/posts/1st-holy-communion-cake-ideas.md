What is innovation?
Innovation is a process of creating new ideas, products, or services that are different from what is already out there. It can also be seen as the change that occurs in the way we use and think about things. Innovation is often seen as something good, like new ways to make our food or clothes. However, sometimes innovation can also be bad, like a new way of advertising that isn't effective.

How to come up with great ideas?
Ideas can be everything from creative to helpful, and they come in all shapes and sizes. To come up with great ideas, it's important to think outside the box. Here are four tips to help you get started:
1. Try different methods: When you have a good idea, don't just sit down and write it down. You might want to try thinking about it from a different perspective or using different language.

2. Get feedback: Take some time to get feedback from people who know what you're trying to do. They might have some great ideas of their own that you can use as a starting point.

3. Be open to change: If your idea is great, but it's not working for someone else, don't be afraid to make changes.

What are some creative methods?
Creative methods can be anything from painting to sculpting, but they all have one common goal: to help you achieve your creative goals. Here are a few tips to get started: 
1. Get organized: When it comes to creative endeavors, organization is key. Not only will this help you keep track of what you’re working on, but it can also inspire you to come up with new ideas. Try keeping a binder or portfolio around with all of your creative works, as well as any sketches, paintings, or sculptures that you may have created in the past. 
2. Draw inspiration from nature: One of the best ways to get inspired by your work is to draw inspiration from nature. Not only will this give you a strong grounding in composition and color, but it can also provide inspiration for new ideas and concepts.
