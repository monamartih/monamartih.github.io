Repainting a Room: Tips and tricks for painting a room successfully.
If you’re looking to spruce up your living room or bedroom, there are a few easy tricks to help out. Here are a few tips to repaint your room successfully:
1) Start with the basics: Paint the walls first and then the ceiling. This will give your painting project a more unified feel.

2) Use a light color for each area of the room: If you want your walls to be in one color, use that color in all of your walls. If you want your ceilings and floors to be different colors, start with one color and add other shades as needed.

3) Don’t forget about trim: Wipe down any debris that may have built up on the wallpapers or flooring, and try to get rid of any excess paint.

What is invention?
Invention is the process of creating something new from something that already exists. Invention ideas can come from anything, from a simple idea to an innovative design. There are many different ways to come up with invention ideas, and each one has its own advantages and disadvantages. Here are some examples: 
1. Inventor: This is the person who comes up with the original idea for the product or service. They may have been working on the same problem for a while and have come up with a better way to do it. 
2. Patenting: This is when someone else comes up with a similar idea to yours, but they have filed for a patent so that you can use their ideas legally. This can give you some control over your invention and make sure it's considered as an original work of art by the public.
