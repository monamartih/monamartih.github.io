How Innovation Can Benefit Your Business: from Cut Costs to Higher Productivity
Innovation is the process of coming up with new ways to do something. It can help businesses cut costs and increase productivity, but there are a few considerations that businesses should make before implementing innovation. First, innovation can be risky - if it doesn't work out, it can cost a lot of money and time to fix. Second, some innovations may not be appropriate for every business - if they're not well-suited to your company's culture or mission, you may find that they don't work as well in the long run. Finally, it's important to remember that innovation often requires time and effort - if you don't take the necessary steps to implement it properly, you could see marginal results for a longer period of time.

What are some big ideas?
Big ideas can be everything from initiating change to creating a new product or service. Here are some of the most commonly cited big ideas:
1. Create a new business model: A lot of businesses start with good intentions, but eventually fall short because they don't have a clear plan for how to turn their idea into a reality. One way to overcome this obstacle is to come up with radical new ideas that could help your business succeed.

2. Implement change: Change is always necessary in order for businesses to grow and succeed. Sometimes, it means taking risks that might not be seen as safe or sexy, but it can lead to real results. It's also important to remember that change takes time - sometimes it's best to take things one step at a time so you can make sure your business is on the right track before making any big changes.

What are big ideas?
There are always big ideas out there, and it can be tough to come up with the perfect one. Here are four tips on how to come up with the best ideas: 
1. Brainstorm with others. Collaborating is key when coming up with big ideas. Talk to people who have experience in the area you want to explore and see what they think would make for an interesting solution. 
2. Avoid clichés. When coming up with big ideas, be mindful of clichés and other tired patterns that have been done before. Are there other ways to approach this problem that haven’t been considered? What new angles could you take into consideration? 
3. Be open to feedback. Don’t be afraid to ask your friends and family for their opinion on your ideas before you EVEN start thinking about putting them together!

How do you come up with new ideas?
As a creative thinker, you face many challenges when coming up with new ideas. One challenge is that it can be difficult to remember just what worked the last time you came up with an idea. Additionally, it can be difficult to come up with novel approaches to problem solving.  So how do you come up with new ideas? 
One approach is to brainstorm. By brainstorming, you can get rid of any old ideas and start from scratch. Additionally, by using headphones or other distractions, you can create an environment in which you are unable to think of any other ideas. Finally, if you have a specific idea in mind but are not sure how to bring it to life, then you can try outframing or milking an existing idea for new potential insights.
