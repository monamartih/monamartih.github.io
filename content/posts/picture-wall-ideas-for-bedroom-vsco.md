The benefits of creative art: what are they?
Creative art has many benefits for both individuals and society. Here are some of the most common: 
1) It can help improve mental health. People who are creative often have more balanced lives than those who are not, and this is especially true when it comes to their mental health. They may find it easier to cope with stress and anxiety, and they may be less likely to suffer from depression or bipolar disorder.

This is especially true for people who are good at problem-solving or creating things from scratch. These skills can then be put to use in other areas of life, such as in the workplace or in hobbies.
3) It can help people connect with others.
