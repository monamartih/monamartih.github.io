Definition of innovation: How does it differ from other types of innovation?
When it comes to innovation, there are a few key differences that can be observed. For one, innovation is not just about coming up with new ideas or products; it also includes taking risks and trying something new in order to create something better. This is what makes innovation so important – it allows companies to constantly improve their products and services while also taking advantage of new opportunities.
But the main difference between innovation and other types of innovation is that innovation is not always about money. In fact, some people argue that innovation should only be considered when it creates value for society as a whole – otherwise, it’s just called “innovation” by those in the business world. However, this doesn’t mean that there isn’t always a cost associated with innovative work – in fact, there often is.

The Relationship of Invention to Technology: What makes an invention useful?
Invention is the process of creating a new product or service from scratch. However, Invention can also bedefined as the creation of a new way of doing something, whether it’s in the realm of technology or business. Inventions have revolutionized how we live, work and interact with the world around us. They have also allowed for advancements in technology that we could never have thought possible. 
However, there are a few things to keep in mind when it comes to Invention. First, Invention has to be useful- if it’s not, it won’t be adopted by society as quickly as some inventions have.
