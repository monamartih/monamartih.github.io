The power of suggestion
Creative ideas are the key to any business or project. When you have a good idea, it's easy to set out to find someone who can help turn that into a reality. Whether you're looking for help with your creative vision or just some recommendations for new companies or products, giving people the opportunity to suggest ideas is one of the most important tools you have in your toolbox.
There are a few things you need in order to give people the opportunity to suggest ideas: first, an idea must be something that someone really wants and desires. Second, it needs to be something that they think could benefit others. And finally, it needs to be something that they think would be interesting and potentially useful for your project or business.

Patent trends: What are some of the latest patent trends?
Patents are a valuable source of intellectual property. They can protect your ideas and inventions from being copied or used without your permission. However, it's important to be aware of thelatest patent trends so you can stay ahead of any potential infringements. Here are some key points to keep in mind: 
1. Inventor protection claims are getting more common. 
2. Patent applications are coming in larger numbers, and they're more complex than ever before. 
3. The number of patents granted is also increasing, but there's still a lot of competition for the same rights and permissions. 
4. There's a growing trend of using Previously Unpublished Data (PUD) in patent applications. This allows inventors to use data that they've already filed with other companies but which they haven't been able to disclose until now.
