Types of creativity: What are they?
Creativity is a critical component of any creative organization. Whether it’s a small business, an artist, or a team of creatives, creativity is essential to making anything happen. There are many types of creativity, but three that are most important to businesses and artists alike are visual, auditory, and kinaesthetic. 
Visual creativity refers to the ability to see something and create ideas based on that. This can be done through drawing or painting, but often starts with seeing the idea in your head and then coming up with ways to turn it into a reality. Auditory creativity comes from creating sounds and melodies based on what you hear. This can be done through music creation or sound engineering, but often starts with imagining how the sound could be used in an application or project. Kinaesthetic creativity refers to the ability to touch something and create ideas based on that.

What is brainstroming?
What is brainstroming? It’s a phenomenon that has baffled scientists for centuries. They can’t explain it, but they know it exists. Brainstroming is when a person’s thoughts and ideas are constantly going through their head, like the thoughts of a machine. The problem is, nobody knows why this happens or how to stop it. Some people say that brainstroming is caused by mental exhaustion or stress, while others say it’s the result of some sort of mental enhancement. There isn’t one answer to this question, and scientists are still trying to figure out what causes brainstroming and how to stop it.
