What are creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything that makes someone happy. Whether it’s a new hobby, a new way of looking at the world, or just something to get them thinking, creativity is a must in any creative person’s life. Here are some fun creative ideas to get you started: 
1. Take on a new challenge: When you feel like you can’t seem to do anything right, take on a new challenge and see if you can do it better than anyone else. This could be as simple as painting or sculpting an expression out of marble, or coming up with your own unique idea for an art project. 
2. Get organized: When you feel lost in your thoughts or don’t know where to start, getting organized will help you find your way back home.

Defining big ideas
There are a lot of big ideas out there. But what exactly are they? And how can we define them?
A big idea is an overarching concept or theme that is central to a work of art, literature, or philosophy. It is usually something that the author wants to communicate to the audience, and it can be interpreted in many ways.

One way to think of a big idea is as a symbol or motif that represents something larger than itself. For example, in the novel The Great Gatsby, the green light on Daisy Buchanan’s dock represents hope and possibility. In Shakespeare’s play Romeo and Juliet, the balcony scene is a symbol of young love and its potential for tragedy.

Another way to define a big idea is as an abstract concept that can be explored in different ways.
