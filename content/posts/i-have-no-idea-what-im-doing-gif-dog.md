Types of creativity: What are they?
Creativity is a complex and multi-layered concept. It can be defined in many ways, but the most commonly accepted definition of creativity would say that it is a process of coming up with new ideas or solutions to problems. There are many different forms of creativity, and it can vary based on who is doing the creative work, what type of creative problem they are trying to solve, and how much input the person has. Here are four types of creative work: visual art, music, writing, and software design.

The definition of invention has changed over time
Invention is an act or process of creating a new product or service from scratch. The definition of invention has changed over time, and the definition of what constitutes an invention has also changed.  In 1876, the International Convention on Patents gave a definitive definition of an invention: "A new production method, composition, use or application of any natural or artificial material." 
However, in 1992, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) revised its rules on what constituted an invention. Previously, inventions were considered to be "natural phenomena" that had not been produced by man. However, under this revision, "natural phenomena" no longer had to be novel; they could just be useful products that had not been used before.

Overcoming creative blocks: what to do when you can't think of anything
When you feel like you can't think of anything, it can be frustrating. But there are ways to overcome creative blocks. Here are a few ideas: 
1. Take a break: Sometimes when you feel like you can't think of anything, it's because you've been thinking too hard. Step away from your work and take a break. Go for a walk, watch a movie, or read a book. Once you take your mind off of your project, you may find that the ideas start flowing again.

2. Talk to someone: When you're feeling stuck, talking to someone else can give you some fresh perspective. Brainstorm with a friend or colleague. They may have some ideas that you hadn't thought of before.
