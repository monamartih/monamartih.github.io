The Impacts of Invention: How does innovation impact society as a whole?
Inventions have been a part of society for centuries, but the impact of innovation has only grown in recent decades. Innovation has the ability to change the way we live and work, as well as the ways we view the world around us. The benefits of innovation are vast, and it has had a positive impact on economies, society, and environment. However, there are some challenges that need to be considered before continuing to see such positive impacts. One key challenge is that innovation can often lead to new technologies that can be dangerous or harmful if not used responsibly. Another challenge is that innovation often depends on someone else’s idea or idea being implemented first, which can lead to competition andefficiency in some industries. Overall, these challenges underscore the importance of ensuring that all who benefit from innovation are taken care of when it comes time for new products or services to be created.

Patenting: How do you patent an invention?
When patenting an invention, there are a few things to keep in mind. One is the idea behind the invention - what is it? Another is the protection that is granted by law - what kind of protection? And finally, how do you go about getting these protections in place? Here are some tips for each: 
- Do your research: Before you file a patent application, it's important to do your research and understand the different types of patents available. There are many different ways to protect an invention, so don't be afraid to start fielding questions from potential patentees about what they can and cannot do. 
- File early: filed early will help get your application filed on time and protected as soon as possible. If you wait too long, other applicants may have already filed their applications, causing your application to languish in the Patent Office for years.
