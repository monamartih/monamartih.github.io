Conclusion
After studyingfor several years, I think that thepractice of brainstroming is a very effective way to improve your thinking skills. Brainstroming is a term that refers to the process of focusing your attention on a specific topic andJamming all of your other thoughts and ideas right into that one area. After doing this for a while, you will be able to see different perspectives more clearly and be able to come up with better solutions to problems.

Invention ideas can be anything from a new way to make a product or service more efficient, to a better way to store food. Sometimes, the best ideas come from scratch â€“ when an inventor has a great idea for something that nobody else has thought of. For example, in the medical world, many people are still surprised by how often diseases sneak up on people unawares. A doctor might come up with a new treatment for cancer that nobody else knew about.

Benefits of creativity: What do you gain from being creative?
Creativity can be defined as the ability to come up with new ideas, ideas that are different from what is currently accepted and/or common, or anything that is original. Creative individuals often have a better imagination and are more creative than those who do not. There are many benefits to being creative, some of which include: increased productivity due to the increased variety of ideas, improved communication and problem-solving skills because of how you can come up with new solutions quickly, and even better grades in school because creativity often leads to new ways of thinking that may be unorthodox but are still effective.
