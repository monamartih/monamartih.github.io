Creative art in the contemporary world: What challenges does creativity face in the 21st century?
Creativity is facing new challenges in the 21st century. One of the most important aspects of creativity is the ability to process information. Many modern day technologies have made it easier for people to get information and create artistry without having to leave their homes. However, this has also created some challenges for creatives. For example, many people no longer need to go outside to experience nature. They can now access creative content online or on screens all around them. This has created a problem for creatives, as they are no longer able to experience the natural environment around them. The other challenge creatives face is that technology has not always been accurate when it comes to depicting real life events and scenes. For example, many people believe that Trump was elected president because he had an "impenetrable" wall with Mexico. However, this is not accurate at all.

The benefits of creativity: What are they?
Creativity is often thought of as a noun, referring to the act or process of producing something new. However, creativity can also be seen as a verb, referring to the act or process of coming up with ideas, concepts and solutions. In order to achieve success in any field, it is important to have a good understanding of creativity and its benefits. Here are three key points that can help you achieve success: 1. Creativity can help you solve problems.

Conclusion: Sum up main points.
Concluding an essay is like tying a bow on a present: it brings everything together and leaves the reader with a sense of closure.

 Restate your thesis in different words.

Make sure your conclusion is as strong as your introduction.

End with a bang! Leave the reader with something to remember.
