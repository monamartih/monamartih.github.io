Definition of creativity: How do you define creativity?
Creativity is the ability to come up with new and improved ideas. There are many different ways to define creativity, but one of the most common definitions is that it is a state of being in which one has an innate ability to think outside theordinary. Creativity can be found in everything from design to technology. It can also be found in people who are passionate about their work and those who have a great idea but not enough time or energy to pursue it.

Why do we have them?: how do they originate?
Most of us have had ideas. Some of us have had great ideas, others less so. But where do these ideas come from? How do they originate?
Ideas can come from anywhere and everywhere. They can come from our own minds, or from the minds of other people. They can come from books, movies, or even just casual conversations.

Ideas can also originate from our experiences. We might have a new idea after experiencing something for the first time, or after seeing someone else experience it. Or we might have an idea that comes to us in a dream.

There is no one answer to where ideas come from. They can come from anywhere and anyone. The important thing is what we do with them once we have them.

How can brainstroming be used in your business?
Do you want to know how you can use brainstroming in your business? If yes, read on. Brainstroming is a powerful tool that can help you understand your customer and find new areas of growth for your business. Here are a few tips to get started:

This will help increase brand awareness and build trust between yourself and your customers.
