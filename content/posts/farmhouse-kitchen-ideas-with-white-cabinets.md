Idea 3: What are some creative ways you can use technology in your work?
Creative ways to use technology in your work is a topic that is constantly on the rise in the workplace. With new technologies being developed constantly, there are endless possibilities for creative ways to use them in your work. Here are three ideas to get started:

How to Use Notes: What are some tips on how to use notes effectively?

However, there are a few things that should be considered before using notes, so as not to waste time and/or miss important points. Here are a few tips: 1) Make use of short, convenient notes. Notes should only contain key information and should not take up large amounts of space. 2) Be specific about what you need noted and when you need it.
