When it comes to big ideas, implementation is key. In order to put your big idea into action, you'll need to have a clear plan and follow the steps involved in developing it. Here are some key things to keep in mind: 
1. Have a strong idea - before you can develop a plan for implementation, you need a strong idea of what you want your big idea to achieve. this may include laying out a clear vision or goal, answering key questions about what users would need and desires, and designing an MVP or Minimum Viable Product that showcases your concept. 
2. Develop an MVP - Once you have a strong idea of what your big idea is, it's time to develop an MVP or Minimum Viable Product that showcases it. This will help validate your hypothesis and get user feedback so that you can continue developing the product with greater confidence.
