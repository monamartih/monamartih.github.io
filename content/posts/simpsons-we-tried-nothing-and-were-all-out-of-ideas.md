How can you improve your brainstroming skills?
If you're looking to boost your brainstroming skills, here are a few tips to get you started. First, keep track of how well you're doing on tasks that require thinking straight – such as solving problems or completing complex algebra problems. Additionally, practice focusing on one task at a time and try to force yourself to stay focused even when faced with difficult challenges. Finally, make sure that you have plenty of practice working with different types of materials (e.g., electronic computers, textiles, images), so that you can develop the critical thinking and problem-solving skills you need for any field.
