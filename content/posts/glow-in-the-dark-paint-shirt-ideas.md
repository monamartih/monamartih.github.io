Technology used in Invention: What are the benefits of using invention?
Invention has many benefits, including reducing costs and time associated with traditional business processes. Additionally, invention can help companies achieve new heights in their industries. However, as with any tool or process, there are drawbacks to using invention for all purposes. Here are five of the most important: 
1) Invention can be limiting in its application: Sometimes, the use of invention results in limitations on what others can do. For example, a company might not be able to produce a product that is as large or successful as they could have been if they used other methods. 
2) Invention can be distracting: Invention often leaves companies feeling like they're "working on something™" instead of actually doing anything productive. This can lead to tension and stress within the workplace, which could have negative consequences for both employees and businesses.
