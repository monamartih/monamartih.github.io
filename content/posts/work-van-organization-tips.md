What are some examples of innovation?
Innovation is the process of creating new products, services, or business models that can be adopted and scale by new businesses or organizations. It can come from scratch or from scratch with help from others. In many cases, innovation is about digging deep and coming up with something completely new. Sometimes this takes years or even a few decades. 
Some examples of innovation are the creation of the smartphone, the internet, GPS navigation systems, and contact lenses. There are also many examples of innovative businesses that started out small but have grown into major success stories. Innovation often comes in all shapes and sizes, making it an important part of any organization’s culture and everyday life.

Conclusion
Innovation has the ability to create new value for businesses and organizations, but it must be managed carefully in order to be successful.

Each stage presents its own challenges and opportunities, but the rewards can be great if innovation is managed effectively.

Limitations of innovation: What are some common limitations to innovation?
The challenges of innovation are well known, but how often do we take the time to understand the limitations of innovation? These limitations can stem from a number of factors, including historical precedent, cultural norms, financial resources, and other constraints.
There are a few key limitations to innovation that should be taken into account when seeking new ideas or concepts:

1. Limitations on creativity: Innovation often comes with a risk of becoming boring or incremental. When trying to come up with new ideas, it is essential to be creative and innovative. However, not all innovations are capable of achieving this level of creativity. In fact, many innovations fall victim to this limit because they lack the ability to surprise or dazzle the audience. This can make it difficult for customers and employees to accept an innovation as new and different than what they have been used to before.
