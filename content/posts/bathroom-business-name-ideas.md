Origins of innovation: How did people get inventive ideas?
Invention ideas come from a diversity of sources, from people who are just starting out, to those who have been working on something for years. But there are some key elements that are always in play when someone comes up with an innovative idea. These include the idea itself, and how it can be realized. For example, a person might come up with the idea of a new product or service, but may not have any clear ideas about how to make it happen. To get started, they need to have some conception of what they want their invention to do and how it could be used. From there, they can work on coming up with a way to make their idea a reality.
