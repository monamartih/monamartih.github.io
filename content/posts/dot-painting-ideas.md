What are the best ways to create ideas?
Ideas are hard to come by, but they're worth taking the time to get. If you can find them, you can use them to help your business or project succeed. Here are five ways to think up ideas: 
1. Brainstorm with other people: When you have a lot of ideas, it can be tough to pick just one. But Brainstorm with other people and see what they have in mind. This will help you come up with a better idea than if you were all alone. 
2. Take some time for yourself: Not everyone is meant to be running their own business. Sometimes it's good to take some time for yourself and do something that's really challenging but also really fun. This will help you come up with new ideas that may not have been previously thought of.
