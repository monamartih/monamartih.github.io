Development of an invention: What steps do I need to take?
Invention ideas are something that can be created within a few hours or even less if you have some creativity and the right tools. To get started, you will need to come up with an idea for a product or service and then develop it further. There are a few key steps that you will need to take in order to create an invention:
1. Choose the right target market. This is where you will figure out what your product or service is meant for and who is the best target audience. You can do this by doing market research or by considering customer feedback.

2. Develop the idea thoroughly. Once you have determined your target market, it is time to develop your idea more fully. This includes coming up with a strong plan for marketing and selling your product or service.

In a time where there are ever-changing ideas and technologies, it is important for businesses to have an idea for their product or service that they can market and sell. Some new ideas are born out of necessity, such as in the case of a product that needs to be small enough to carry without being cumbersome, but too large or expensive to create a viable business model around. Other ideas may come from looking at what others are doing and seeing how they could be improved.
