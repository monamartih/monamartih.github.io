1) Introduction to computer programming – This is a new course that has been moderately successful in increasing interest in computer science. It covers everything from basic coding to more complex topics, making it an excellent introduction to the field for those who want to start homebrewing or develop their own software projects. 
2) A way for people with mental health conditions to interact with the world – This is a trend that is growing slowly but surely, as more and more people realize just how important it is for people with mental health conditions to have access to support and information (and not just be left on their own). Some companies are starting to create websites and apps specifically for people with mental health conditions, so this trend is only going to continue growing.

Creativity in the workplace
A recent study has shown that creativity in the workplace is on the decline. This is due to a number of factors, including the increased pressure to succeed and the lack of time to truly be creative. However, there are a few ways to encourage creativity in the workplace.
One way to encourage creativity in the workplace is to set aside time for brainstorming sessions. During these sessions, employees should feel free to share any ideas they have, no matter how far-fetched they may seem. The goal is to get employees thinking outside of the box and coming up with new and innovative ideas.

Another way to encourage creativity in the workplace is to offer incentives for coming up with new and creative ideas. This could be anything from a cash bonus to extra vacation days. Whatever the incentive may be, it should be something that employees are motivated to achieve.

Overcoming creative blocks.
Creativity is a trait that is often associated with artists, musicians, and other professionals in the arts. However, creativity is not just a talent that only these people possess. Everyone has the ability to be creative, but sometimes we can get stuck in a rut and find it difficult to be creative. If you're feeling uninspired, here are a few tips to help you overcome your creative block.
1. Take a break from your project. Sometimes the best way to get out of a funk is to take a break from whatever you're working on. Step away from your work and clear your mind. Go for a walk, watch a movie, or read a book. When you come back to your project, you'll have fresh eyes and a new perspective.

2. Talk to other people about your project.
