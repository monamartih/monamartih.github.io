Brainstorming: What are some great ways to come up with new ideas?
This article is about brainstorming ideas, and how to come up with new ones. There are a few things to keep in mind when brainstorming: 
- Make sure you have a wide range of ideas - Brainstorming can be helpful if you have a few good ideas but no specific plan for calling them all together. 

- Be organized - When you have a bunch of great ideas, it can be helpful to jot them down in order of importance. This will help you keep track of what's important and which ones need more work. 

- Be patient - It can take some time to come up with good ideas. Don't get discouraged if your first batch doesn't seem as great as you wanted it to. You can always try again later.

How to: Start with the most common projects and work your way up
If you're just starting out, there are a few things to keep in mind when embarking on your first DIY project. First and foremost, don't be afraid to ask for help – everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses when it comes to construction. And if you have any trouble understanding something or struggling with a project, don't worry; anyone can learn from experience.
Of course, no one is born knowing how to do everything by themselves – that's where the importance of having some type of plan comes in. Not only will this help you avoid becoming overwhelmed and frustrated, but it'll also make sure that your projects get completed on time and without any unforeseen problems. So go ahead and start building – it's the least you can do!
