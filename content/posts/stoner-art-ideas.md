The difference between left brain and right brain thinking:
Most people use both sides of their brain for thinking, but some people tend to use one side more than the other. Left-brain thinkers are usually more logical and analytical, while right-brain thinkers are usually more creative.
Left-brain thinkers tend to be better at things like math and science, because they can break things down into smaller pieces and see the logic behind them. Right-brain thinkers tend to be better at things like art and music, because they can see the big picture and come up with creative ideas.

Both types of thinking are important, and most people use both sides of their brain for different tasks. But if you want to be good at something that requires creativity, then you’ll need to learn how to use your right brain more.

How to come up with big ideas
When it comes to coming up with big ideas, the first step is to have a clear idea of what you want your business to achieve. Once you know what you want, it's time to start thinking about how you can achieve it. Here are four tips for coming up with big ideas: 
1. Look at your industry and think about how you could improve it. Why isn't there enough innovation in this industry? Why are some products more popular than others? What could be done to make sure that your product or service is better?
2. Come up with a goal that you can focus on and work towards. This will help give you the motivation to keep going when the going gets tough. Without a goal, it's hard to stay motivated and keep exploring new ideas. 
3. Make a list of possible ways that your business could improve.
