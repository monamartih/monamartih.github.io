What are big ideas?
Big ideas are important, but they can be hard to come by. Here are some tips on finding big ideas that will help you succeed: 
1. Define what you want your business to achieve. Once you have a clear idea of what your business wants to accomplish, it's easier to come up with ideas for how to achieve it. 
2. Think about who your target market is. Big businesses often think about their target market as all the people who are potential customers or employees who might be interested in their product or service. However, there are also many people out there who don't have a specific interest in your product or service, and you need to include them in your thinking while developing your big idea. 
3. Create a vision and mission statement.
