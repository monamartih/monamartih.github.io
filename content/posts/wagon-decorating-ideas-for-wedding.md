Tips for working with clients
Creative Ideas: When working with clients, always have an idea of what you want to achieve. This will help you to better understand the client's needs and desires. Additionally, it can give you a starting point for your proposals and ideas. If you're not sure what the client wants, ask them! This will help to ensure that your proposal is tailored specifically to their needs and wishes. Finally, be sure to keep in mind that no one is perfect, so don't expect anything from your clients without first trying your best.

How can we turn big ideas into real projects?
How can we turn big ideas into real projects? There are a few key strategies that can help. First, we need to identify the big idea. Once we know what it is, our next step is to develop a plan for how to make it a reality. Once we have a plan, it’s time to gather the resources necessary to make it happen. This might include money, manpower, or other resources that we can borrow from others or give away. If all of these resources are available, the next step is to put together a team of advisors who can help us achieve our goals.
