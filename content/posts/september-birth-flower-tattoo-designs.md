The 5 Types of Ideas: What they are, what they can do, when to use them, and how we can get started
Ideas are a powerful tool that can help us solve problems. Here are five types of ideas to get started with:
1. Problem identifies and solves: This type of idea is used when you have a specific problem to solve, and there are no other options available. For example, if you’re lost and need to find your way home, you might use this type of idea to identify the problem and come up with a plan to fix it.

2. Plan creation: This type of idea is used to create a plan that will help you achieve your goals. In many cases, this plan will include steps that you can take immediately or that will require some planning (such as setting a date for your meeting).

Why is innovation important?
Innovation is important because it drives economic growth. Innovation can be found in everything from the smallest details of a product to the most complex algorithms. It enables businesses to create new products and services that meet customer needs, and it also allows them to stay ahead of their competition.
But innovation isn't just about making new products or services; it's also about creating new ways for businesses to do their work. This may seem like a relatively small detail, but it could provide the company with an edge over its competitors. For example, imagine a business that is able to create custom-made shoes Made in America. That company would be much more likely to be successful than one that relies on global production methods.

Innovation is also important because it helps companies keep up with changing technology.
