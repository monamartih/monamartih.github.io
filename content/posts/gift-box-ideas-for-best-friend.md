The future of work: What will new technologies mean for the workforce?
New technologies will have a significant impact on the workforce in the not too distant future. They include things like artificial intelligence (AI), nanotechnology, and robotics. All of these new technologies present opportunities and challenges for the workforce. 
One important thing to note is that no one technology will be completely dominant. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages. 

For example, AI can help improve efficiency in many industries, such as retail or factory work. However, it can also lead to unemployment if used incorrectly. 

Nanotechnology offers a number of potential solutions for improving efficiency in businesses and workplaces. However, it is still in its early stages of development and has some potential drawbacks as well. For example, nanotechnology-based clothing can't be recycled so it needs to be disposed of properly or stored away for long periods of time.

Creative expression: The creative act and the creative media
Creative expression is the process of coming up with new ideas, expressing them through creative means and then sharing these ideas with others. The creative act involves the individualâ€™s thoughts, feelings and creativity as well as the medium through which they are expressed. The creative media includes both tangible and intangible forms, such as art, music, motion pictures and television. As we learn to express ourselves more creatively, we also learn to create more effectively in order to improve our businesses, relationships and lives.
