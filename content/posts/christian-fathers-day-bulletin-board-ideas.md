Creative process: What are the steps?
Creative processes vary depending on the individual, but typically there are three main steps. The first step is to come up with an idea or idea for a project. This can be done through any creative medium such as writing, drawing, painting, etc. Once the idea has been created it is important to test it out and see how it sounds or looks. The second step is to create a rough plan or outline of the project. This will help to better understand what needs to be done and when. The third step is to begin working on the project.
