Invention: The history of invention
Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea, whether it is a new product, service or technology. It has been around for centuries and has had a wide variety of outcomes. 
One of the earliest examples of invention was in 100 BC when two brothers, Eudoxus and Philoctetes, came up with the idea of writing. They were the first to patent their invention and it soon became a household word. 

Inventions have also been used for military purposes. The world’s first anti-tank grenade was created by Raphael Salomon in 1795 and it was used in World War 1 to help destroy German tanks. 

Today, innovation continues to play an important role in our lives. There are many different ways that innovation can be used to create new products, services and technologies.

Conclusion: What to do if You Start a Blog but Do Not Have Any Ideas
A lot of people start blogs, but they don't know what to do next. Here are some tips to help you get started: 
1) Choose a topic you're interested in. Once you've chosen a topic, research how to write about it effectively. You can find helpful articles and tutorials online or in books.
2) Start with a small audience. If your blog only has a handful of readers, you'll likely be able to start off by posting updates and tasks related to your topic rather than developing your content further. 
3) Take some time for planning and editing. Once you've created an initial post, make sure to spend time editing it and proofreading it for errors. This will help make sure that your blog is well-written and error-free before publishing it!
