The nine types of innovation: How do they differ and what benefits can they provide?
Innovation is the process of coming up with new ideas and concepts that can change the way we do things. It can come in the form of a new product, service, or idea. In some cases, innovation can also mean changing how we think about something. For example, when we think about innovation, we may remember Chuck Norris fighting aliens in a video game.
