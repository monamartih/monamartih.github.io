Creative process is the process that goes behind the creation of any artwork. This can be anything from a simple idea to a masterpiece. There are many different steps that go into creating an artwork, and it can be difficult to determine which one is responsible for the finished product.

This includes making sure your images are clear, considering how your work will be displayed, and figuring out what type of paper or canvas you’ll need to create your artwork on.
