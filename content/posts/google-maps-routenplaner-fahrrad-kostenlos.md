How to brainstorm effectively
When it comes to brainstorming, there are a few things you can do to make sure you're doing it effectively. First, it's important to have a clear goal in mind. What are you trying to achieve with this brainstorming session? Once you know what you're trying to accomplish, you can start generating ideas. It's helpful to write down every idea that comes to mind, no matter how crazy or far-fetched it may seem. You can always weed out the bad ideas later. The goal is just to get as many ideas as possible at this stage. Once you have a good list of ideas, start looking for patterns and connections between them. This will help you start narrowing down your options and come up with a plan of action. Brainstorming can be a great way to generate new ideas and solve problems, but only if you do it effectively.

Patenting: How do you patent an invention?
When patenting an invention, there are a few things to keep in mind. One is the idea behind the invention - what is it? Another is the protection that is granted by law - what kind of protection? And finally, how do you go about getting these protections in place? Here are some tips for each: 
- Do your research: Before you file a patent application, it's important to do your research and understand the different types of patents available. There are many different ways to protect an invention, so don't be afraid to start fielding questions from potential patentees about what they can and cannot do. 
- File early: filed early will help get your application filed on time and protected as soon as possible. If you wait too long, other applicants may have already filed their applications, causing your application to languish in the Patent Office for years.
