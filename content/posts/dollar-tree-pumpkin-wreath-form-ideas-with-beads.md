Types of innovation
There are many types of innovation, each with its own benefits and drawbacks. To get a better understanding of what types of innovation are available, it can be helpful to look at some examples. 
Innovation can come in the form of new products or services, new methods for doing something, or a change in how things are done. There are many different types of innovation available, so it is important to find what best suits your needs and business goals. 

Some benefits of innovation include improving customer service and satisfaction, creating new markets for products or services, expanding the reach of an existing product or service, and increasing productivity. However, there are also risks associated with any type of innovation. For example, if a company over-promises or under-delivers on their new product or service, this could harm their reputation and cause customers to abandon them.

Defining Innovation
Innovation is a term that is used frequently but often left undefined. This creates confusion when discussing innovation and can lead to misunderstanding its true meaning. When speaking about innovation, one must first define it in order to have a common understanding of the topic at hand.
Innovation is typically defined as introducing something new, whether it be an idea, method, or product. However, this definition does not capture the full scope of what innovation entails. Innovation often leads to change, which can be either incremental or radical. Incremental change is small and gradual, while radical change is more significant and happens suddenly. Both types of changes are essential for innovation to occur.

There are many factors that contribute to innovation. One important factor is a companyâ€™s culture.
