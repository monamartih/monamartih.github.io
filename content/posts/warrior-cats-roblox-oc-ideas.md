The future of technology is constantly in flux, and so is the way we view it.
In the coming years, technology will continue to change and evolve at an alarming rate. Some of the most exciting new ideas that come up in these times are artificial intelligence (AI), big data, blockchain technology, and 3D printing. With these technologies becoming more popular every day, it's important to keep up with the latest trends and developments in order to be ahead of the curve. Here are some examples of how AI is already changing the way we view the world: 
It has long been speculated that AI could soon become self-aware and even sentient. In a recent study published in "Nature", researchers have created a computer program that can learn from itself and develop its own strategy. This is a huge achievement because until now, it has been difficult for computers to learn from their own mistakes.

What are some 2020 ideas?
2020 is a year of opportunity. It's a time to think about what we can do to make our world a better place. Here are two ideas that could help: 
The first is the United Nations' " Agenda 21 ," which calls for creating an international body to focus on sustainable development. This would be a great way to bring together different groups of people who have something to say about how the world should be run, and it would also be a good way to learn from other countries. 
The second is the Global Compact on climate change, which was started in 2014 by more than 190 countries. The idea behind it is that all countries must take steps to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, or less. This would mean reducing emissions from industries and buildings, improving energy efficiency, and investing in renewable energy sources.
