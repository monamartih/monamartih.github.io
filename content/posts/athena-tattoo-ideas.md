Trends in technology: How is technology changing?
Technology is constantly evolving, and with it, the way we live and work. In 2020, there are many ideas for how technology will change in the next year. Here are a few examples: 
- digitize everything: physical things will be digitized to the point where they can be stored and accessed from any device. This could include everything from your phone to your books. 
- AI will take over jobs: machines are starting to become smarter than people and can now do most tasks on their own. This could lead to layoffs in the workforce as companies adopt AI strategies to save money. 
- Virtual Reality will take over: our reality will be turned into a virtual one, allowing us to experience different worlds without ever leaving our home. This could have a number of implications, such as making travel more comfortable or increasing creativity.

What are the benefits of having ideas?
Ideas can be a powerful tool for improving business efficiency, creativity, and overall productivity. By having more ideas, businesses can move faster and make better decisions when it comes to product innovation, marketing campaigns, and even store design. In fact, the more ideas a business has, the harder it is to stay ahead of the competition. Here are four reasons why you should start taking advantage of all those innovative juices:
